The head office is located in Germany and the editorial decisions concerning the audiovisual media service are taken there,\n2. The head office is located in Germany and the editorial decisions concerning the audiovisual media service are taken in a different Member State of the European Union, but\na) a substantial part of the personnel entrusted with the implementation of program-related activities is active in Germany or\nb) a substantial part of the personnel entrusted with the provision of the audiovisual media service is employed both in Germany and in the other Member State of the European Union, or\nc) a substantial part of the personnel entrusted with program-related activities does not work in Germany or the other Member State of the European Union, but the television broadcaster in Germany first started its activity and a permanent and actual connection with the German economy persists, or\n3. The head office is situated in Germany and the editorial decisions concerning the audiovisual media service are taken in a non-EU state, or vice versa, but a substantial part of the personnel entrusted with the provision of the audiovisual media service is employed in Germany.\n(4) For television broadcasters, insofar as they are not already subject to legal sovereignty in Germany or another Member State of the European Union, this State Treaty and the provisions of state law also apply in the event of the following:\n1. If they use a satellite ground station located in Germany for the uplink or\n2. Although they do not use a satellite ground station in a Member State of the European Union for the uplink, they do use transmission capacity from a satellite allocated to Federal Republic of Germany.\nIf neither of these two criteria are met, this State Treaty and the state law provisions also apply to television broadcasters if they broadcast in Germany in accordance with §§ 49 to 55 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, OJ C 115, 9 May 2008 p. 47.\n(5) This State Treaty and the state law provisions do not apply to programmes of television broadcasters that\n1. Are intended exclusively for reception in third countries and\n2. Are not broadcasted directly or indirectly to the general public on commercially available consumer devices in a country within the scope of Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (OJ L 95, 15 April 2010, p. 1).\n(6) The provisions of Section II and Section IV of this State Treaty only apply to teleshopping channels if this is expressly determined.\n(7) This State Treaty applies to providers of telemedia if they are established in the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with the provisions of the Telemedia Act.\n(8) Notwithstanding paragraph 7, this State Treaty applies to media intermediaries, media platforms and user interfaces insofar as they are intended for use in Germany. Media intermediaries, media platforms or user interfaces are to be regarded as intended for use in Germany if they are aimed at users in the Federal Republic of Germany, in particular through the language used, the content or marketing activities offered, or if they aim to refinance a substantial part of such in the Federal Republic of Germany. For the purposes of §§ 97 to 100, this State Treaty applies to video sharing services within the scope of Directive (EU) 2010/13/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/1808/EU, if they comply with the regulations of the Telemedia Act established in the Federal Republic of Germany; otherwise sentence 1 applies.\n(9) Television broadcasters are obliged to inform the body responsible under state law of any changes that could affect the establishment of sovereignty under paragraphs 3 and 4. State media authorities shall compile a list of private television broadcasters subject to legal sovereignty in Germany, keep them up to date and state on which of the criteria mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 the sovereignty is based. The list and all updates to this list will be sent to the European Commission together with the list of public service broadcasters."}

The term includes offers that are distributed in encrypted form or that can be received for a special fee. Telemedia are all electronic information and communication services unless they are telecommunications services as per § 3 subparagraph 24 of the Telecommunications Act which wholly involve the transmission of signals via telecommunications networks, or are telecommunications-supported services pursuant to § 3 subparagraph 25 of the Telecommunications Act or radio broadcasting as per sentences 1 and 2.\n(2) In accordance with this Act, this State Treaty applies to:\n1. Broadcast programmes wherein a sequence of content is scheduled according to a broadcasting schedule,\n2. Long-term broadcasting schedules, determined by the organiser and that cannot be changed by the user in terms of the content and timing of programmes,\n3. Transmission of a closed, time-limited individual component of a broadcasting schedule or catalogue, regardless of its length, which is contiguous,\n4. A full radio programme with diverse contents, in which information, education, advice and entertainment form an essential part of the overall programme,\n5. A divisional programme which is a radio programme with essentially the same content,\n6. A regional window programme whose broadcast is limited in terms of time and space, with essentially regional content as part of a main programme,\n7.

Advertising is, in particular, radio advertising, sponsoring, teleshopping and product placement; § 8 paragraph 9 and § 22(1) sentences 2 and 3 remain unaffected,\n8. Broadcast advertising is any statement in the exercise of a trade, business, craft or profession that is broadcast on the radio by a public or private broadcaster or an individual either for a fee or a similar consideration or as self-promotion, with the aim of promoting the sale of goods or the provision of services, including immovable property, rights and obligations, for a fee,\n9. Surreptitious advertising is the mention or representation of goods, services, names, brands or activities of a manufacturer of goods or a provider of services in programmes if it is intentionally provided by the organiser for advertising purposes and, in the absence of labelling, may mislead the general public regarding the actual purpose of this mention or representation. A mention or representation is considered to be intended for advertising purposes in particular if it is for a fee or a similar consideration,\n10. Sponsorship of any contribution by an individual or legal entity or an association that is not involved in radio activities, the provision of telemedia comparable to broadcasting or video sharing services or the production of audiovisual works, for direct or indirect funding of radio programmes, telemedia comparable to broadcasting, video sharing services, user-generated videos or a programme to promote a name, brand, appearance of the person or association, their activity or services,\n11.

Product placement means any form of advertising consisting of incorporating or referring to a product, service or brand, for a fee or similar consideration, so that it appears within a programme or a user-generated video. The free provision of goods or services is product placement if the goods or services in question are of significant value,\n13. Broadcast-like telemedia is telemedia with content that is similar in form and design to radio or television and that is provided from a catalogue specified by a provider for individual access at a time selected by the user (audio and audiovisual media services on demand); Contents are in particular radio plays, feature films, series, reports, documentaries, entertainment, information or children’s programmes,\n14. Media platform of any telemedia, insofar as it combines radio, telemedia comparable to broadcasting or telemedia according to § 19(1) into an overall offer determined by the provider.

Media intermediary for any telemedia that also aggregates, selects and presents third-party journalistic and editorial offers without making them available as a whole,\n17. Broadcasters who offer a radio programme under their own responsibility,\n18. Provider of telemedia comparable to broadcasting, who decides on the selection of the content and bears the responsibility for the content,\n19.

Media intermediary provider, who is responsible for the aggregation, selection and generally accessible presentation of content,\n22. Video sharing service means a telemedia service in which the main purpose of the service or a separable part of the service or an essential function of the service is to provide programmes to the general public with moving images or user-generated videos for which the service provider has no editorial responsibility, and where the service provider determines the organisation of the programmes or the user-generated videos, which can also mean by automatic means,\n23. Video sharing service provider, who operates a video sharing service,\n24. User-generated video of a sequence of moving images with or without sound created by a user, which is an individual component regardless of its length and which is uploaded to a video sharing service by this or another user,\n25.

Mislead or harm the interests of consumers, or\n4. Promote behaviours that endanger health or safety, as well as the protection of the environment.\n(2) Radio advertising forms part of the programme. Radio advertising or advertisers may not influence the rest of the programme in terms of content or editorial content. Sentences 1 and 2 apply accordingly to teleshopping spots, teleshopping windows and their providers.\n(3) Advertising must be easily recognisable as such and distinguishable from the editorial content. No subliminal influencing techniques may be used in advertising. Even when new advertising technologies are used, radio advertising and teleshopping must be separated from the other parts of the programme appropriately by clear optical, acoustic, or spatial means.\n(4) Partial coverage of the broadcast image with radio advertising is permitted if the radio advertising is clearly optically separated from the rest of the programme and identified as such. This radio advertising is counted towards the duration of the spot advertising according to §§ 39 and 70. § 9(1) applies accordingly.\n(5) Continuous advertising programmes are permitted if the advertising aspect is clearly in the foreground and the advertising is an essential part of the broadcast. They must be announced as a continuous advertising programme at the beginning and marked as such throughout their entire duration. Sentences 1 and 2 also apply to teleshopping.\n(6) The insertion of virtual advertising in programmes is permitted if\n1. Such is announced at the beginning and at the end of the programme in question, and\n2. If it replaces any advertising that already exists at the place of transmission.\nOther rights shall remain unaffected.

Product placement is permitted, except in news programmes, programmes for political information, consumer programmes, regional window programmes in accordance with § 59(4), window programmes in accordance with § 65, programmes with religious content and children’s programmes. Programmes that contain product placement must meet the following requirements:\n1. The editorial responsibility and independence regarding content and placement in the broadcast schedule must remain unaffected,\n2. The product placement must not directly encourage the purchase, rental or lease of goods or services, in particular not by means of special sales-promoting references to these goods or services, and\n3. The product must not be emphasised too strongly; this also applies to low-value goods that are made available free of charge.\nProduct placement must be clearly indicated. It must be appropriately identified at the beginning and end of a programme and when it continues after an advertising break or on the radio by means of an equivalent notice. The labelling requirement does not apply to programmes that have not been produced or commissioned by the organiser itself or by a company affiliated with the organiser, and unless it can be determined with reasonable effort whether product placement is included; this should be pointed out. The state broadcasting corporations, ZDF and the state media authorities, which are part of ARD, establish uniform labelling.\n(8) In television advertising and teleshopping on television, no person may appear who regularly presents news programmes or programmes on current political affairs.\n(9) Political, ideological or religious advertising is not permitted. Sentence 1 applies, mutatis mutandis, to teleshopping. Free public service contributions, including calls for donations for charity purposes, are not considered advertising within the meaning of sentence 1. § 68 remains unaffected.\n(10) Advertising and teleshopping for alcoholic beverages must not promote excessive consumption of such beverages.\n(11) The non-nationwide distribution of radio advertising or other content in a nationwide programme or a commissioned or authorised nationwide distribution is only permitted if and to the extent permitted by the law of the country in which the non-nationwide distribution takes place. A non-nationwide broadcast advertising or other content from private broadcasters requires a separate state approval; this can be made dependent on the content requirements to be determined by law.\n(12) Nor do paragraphs 1-11 apply to teleshopping channels."}

If there is no agreement on the appropriateness of the conditions, the parties should agree on arbitration in accordance with §§ 1025 et seqq. of the Code of Civil Procedure in good time before the event; if the agreement of an arbitration procedure does not occur for reasons for which the television broadcaster or the third party is responsible, the broadcast according to sentence 1 is not considered to be possible under reasonable conditions. Only a programme that is actually available in more than two thirds of households is considered to be a generally accessible television programme.\n(2) For the purposes of this Ordinance, the following are defined as major events:\n1. Olympic summer and winter games,\n2. European and World Championships in football, all games with German participation as well as the opening game, the semi-finals and the final, regardless of German participation,\n3. The semi-finals and the final for the Club Cup of the German Football Association,\n4. Home and away games of the German national football team,\n5. Finals of the European Club Championships in football (Champions League, Europa League) with German participation.\nIn the case of major events that consist of several individual events, each individual event counts as a major event. The inclusion or removal of events in this provision is only permitted by a State Treaty in all countries.\n(3) If a Member State of the European Union shares its provisions on the broadcasting of major events in accordance with § 3a of Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Commission and if the Commission does not raise any objections within 3 months of the notification and if the provisions of the Member State concerned are published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the broadcast of major events is encrypted and for a fee for that Member State is only permitted if the broadcaster enables broadcasting in a freely accessible programme in accordance with the provisions of the Member State concerned published in the Official Journal.\n(4) If provisions of a state which has ratified the European Convention on Transfrontier Television as amended in the amending protocol of 9 September 1998 have been published in accordance with the procedure referred to in § 9a paragraph 3 of the Convention, this regulation applies to broadcasters in the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with sentence 4, unless the Prime Ministers of the federal states refuse to recognise the regulation within a period of 6 months via a unanimous decision.

This right includes the power of access, short-term direct transmission, recording, their evaluation for a single contribution and the disclosure under the conditions of paragraphs 2 to 12.\n(2) Other statutory provisions, in particular those of copyright and personal protection, remain unaffected.\n(3) Paragraph 1 does not apply to the churches and other religious communities and their institutions with the corresponding tasks.\n(4) The free short report is limited to a short news report corresponding to the occasion. The permissible duration is based on the length of time it takes to convey the informational content of the event. In the case of short-term and regularly recurring events of a similar nature, the maximum duration is usually one and a half minutes. If brief reports on events of a comparable type are summarised, the summary character must also be preserved in this summary.\n(5) The right to short reporting must be exercised in such a way that there are no avoidable disruptions to the event. The organiser can restrict or exclude the transmission or recording if it can be assumed that otherwise the execution of the event would be questioned or the moral sense of the event participants would be grossly violated. The right to short reporting is excluded if there are reasons for public security and order and these outweigh the public interest in information. The organiser’s right to exclude the transmission or recording of the event as a whole remains unaffected.\n(6) For the exercise of the right to short reporting, the organiser can demand the generally provided entrance fee; otherwise, they must be reimbursed for the necessary expenses incurred through the exercise of the right.\n(7) For the exercise of the right to short reporting on professional events, the organiser can demand a low fee corresponding to the nature of the short reporting. If no agreement is reached on the amount of the remuneration, arbitration proceedings should be agreed in accordance with §§ 1025 et seqq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. The absence of an agreement on the amount of the remuneration or on the conduct of arbitration does not prevent the exercise of the right to short reporting; the same applies to a pending legal dispute regarding the amount of the remuneration.\n(8) Exercising the right to short reporting requires the television broadcaster to register with the broadcaster at least 10 days before the start of the event. The latter must notify the registering television broadcasters at least 5 days before the start of the event whether there are sufficient spatial and technical possibilities for transmission or recording. For short-term events, registrations must be made as early as possible.\n(9) If the spatial and technical conditions are not sufficient for all registrations to be taken into account, the television broadcasters who have concluded contractual agreements with the broadcaster or the sponsor of the event have priority. In addition, the organiser or the sponsor of the event has the right to choose. First of all, those television broadcasters must be taken into account that ensure comprehensive coverage of the country in which the event takes place.\n(10) TV broadcasters who take care of the short reporting are obliged to make the signal and the recording available immediately to those broadcasters against reimbursement of the reasonable expenses that could not be approved.\n(11) If the broadcaster or the sponsor of an event enters into a contractual agreement with a television broadcaster for reporting, they must ensure that at least one other television broadcaster may receive a short report.\n(12) The parts not used for the short reporting must be destroyed no later than 3 months after the end of the event; the event organiser or carrier of the event must be informed of the destruction in writing. The deadline is interrupted by the exercise of the legitimate interests of third parties.\n§ 15\nEuropean productions, own, commissioned and joint productions\n(1) The broadcasters contribute to securing German and European film and television productions as cultural assets and as part of their audiovisual heritage.\n(2) In order to present the diversity in German-speaking and European countries and to promote European film and television productions, television broadcasters should reserve the majority of their total airtime for feature films, television games, series, documentaries and comparable productions in accordance with European law.\n(3) Full television programmes should contain a significant proportion of in-house productions as well as commissioned and joint productions from German-speaking and European countries. The same applies to television programmes, insofar as this is possible according to their main focus.\n(4) As part of its programme mandate and taking into account the principles of efficiency and economy, public service broadcasting is entitled to provide qualitative and quantitative assurance of its programme procurement to participate in film grants without having to pay anything in return. Other state regulations remain unaffected."}

The same applies to a slight drop in the audience share, provided that the company has a dominant position in a media-related market or an overall assessment of its activities on television and in media-related markets shows that the influence of opinion thereby achieved is that of a company with an audience share corresponding to 30 per cent of a television audience share.\n(3) If a company has gained a predominant opinion with the programmes attributable to it, no approval may be granted for other programmes attributable to this company or the acquisition of further attributable participations in organisers must not be confirmed as harmless.\n(4) If a company has gained a predominant opinion with the programmes attributable to it, the responsible state media agency proposes to the company the following measures for determining the concentration in the media area (KEK, § 106 paragraph 2 sentence 1 subparagraph 3):\n1. The company can give them attributable participations in organisers until the attributable audience share of the company thereby falls below the limit according to paragraph 2 sentence 1, or\n2. In the case of paragraph 2 sentence 2, it can reduce its market position in media-related markets or give up attributable participations in organisers until there is no longer a predominant opinion under paragraph 2 sentence 2, or\n3. It can take measures to ensure diversity within the meaning of §§ 64 to 66 with the organisers attributable to it.\nThe KEK discusses the possible measures with the company with the aim of bringing about an amicable settlement. If no agreement can be reached or if the measures mutually agreed between the company and the KEK are not carried out within a reasonable period of time, the responsible state media agency, after the KEK has determined such, must revoke the approvals of so many programmes attributable to the company until a prevailing opinion the company is clearer. The KEK makes the selection taking into account the particularities of the individual case. No compensation shall be awarded for pecuniary losses as a result of the withdrawal of approval.\n(5) If an organiser with a full programme or a speciality programme with a focus on information reaches an audience share of 10 per cent on average within 1 year, they must allow airtime time for independent third parties within 6 months of the determination and notification by the responsible state media authority in accordance with § 65. If the organiser does not take the necessary measures, the responsible state media agency must revoke the approval after it has been determined by the KEK. Paragraph 4 sentence 5 applies accordingly.\n(6) The state media outlets jointly publish a report by the KEK every 3 years or at the request of the federal states on the development of concentration and on measures to ensure diversity of opinion in private broadcasting, taking into account\n1. Interconnections between television and media-related related markets,\n2. Horizontal links between broadcasters in different distribution areas and\n3. International media ties.\nThe report is also intended to comment on the application of §§ 60 to 66 and any necessary changes to these provisions.\n(7) The state media authorities publish a programme list to be drawn up by the KEK on an annual basis.

The window programme must be designed independently of the main programme.\n(2) The duration of the window programme must be at least 260 minutes per week, of which at least 75 minutes must be during airtime from 7 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. Regional window programmes of up to a maximum of 150 minutes per week with a maximum of 80 minutes per week are counted towards the weekly airtime and the third airtime outside the broadcasting period specified in sentence 1; with a lower weekly broadcast time for the regional window, the creditable broadcast time is reduced accordingly by 80 minutes. Crediting is only permitted if the regional window programmes are organised with editorial independence and reach a total of at least 50 per cent of the television households in Germany. Falling below this range is permissible in the course of digitising the transmission paths.\n(3) The window programme provider according to paragraph 1 must not be legally dependent on the main programme organiser. Legal dependency within the meaning of sentence 1 exists if the main programme and the window programme can be attributed to the same company in accordance with § 62.\n(4) If a main programme broadcaster is obliged to grant airtime for independent third parties, the responsible state media agency, after having discussed with the main broadcaster, announces the window programme for granting approval. The responsible state media authority checks the incoming applications for their compatibility with the provisions of this State Treaty and the other state law provisions and notifies the main broadcaster of the applications that are eligible for approval. It discusses the proposals with the main programme organiser with the aim of making an amicable selection. If an agreement is not reached and the responsible state media agency has more than three admissible applications, the main broadcaster submits a tripartite proposal to the responsible state media agency. The responsible state media authority can add up to two further suggestions from a diversity perspective, which it then discusses again with the main broadcaster with the aim of making a mutually acceptable selection. If an agreement is not reached, it will select from the proposals the applicant whose programme is expected to make the greatest possible contribution to diversity in the programme of the main programme organiser and shall approve such. If there are three or fewer applications, the responsible state media authority makes the decision immediately.\n(5) If an applicant is selected for the window programme according to paragraph 4, the main programme organiser and the applicant conclude an agreement on the broadcasting of the window programme as part of the main programme. This agreement particularly includes the obligation of the main programme organiser to enable the window programme organiser to adequately finance its programme. The agreement must also stipulate that termination during the period of approval under paragraph 6 is only permissible due to serious breaches of contract or for an important reason with a period of 6 months.\n(6) On the basis of an agreement on reasonable conditions in accordance with paragraph 5, the window programme organiser is to be granted approval by the responsible state media authority to organise the window programme. In the approval of the main and the window programme organiser, the essential obligations from the agreement according to paragraph 5 are to be included as part of the approval. No compensation shall be awarded for pecuniary losses as a result of a partial withdrawal of approval from the main programme organiser. Approval for the window programme organiser is to be granted for a period of 5 years; it expires if the approval of the main broadcaster ends, is not extended or is not re-issued."}

{"chunk_id": 145, "doc_title": "Report on the Operation of Directive (EU) 2015-1535", "heading_2": "Executive summary", "heading_3": "na", "heading_4": "na", "chunk": "Executive summary\nThis report analyses the application of one of the cornerstones of the internal market from 2014 to 2015: the notification procedure laid down by Directive (EU) 2015/1535 (hereinafter referred to as the \"Single Market Transparency Directive\"). The report highlights the important contribution of the notification procedure to the functioning of the Single Market and to the implementation of the Better Regulation policy.\nDirective (EU) 2015/1535 was adopted on 9 September 2015 and repealed and replaced Directive 98/34/EC. Since Directive 98/34/EC had been substantially amended several times (notably to include Information Society services and to remove technical standards from its scope), a decision was taken to codify it in the interest of clarity.\nThe notification to the Commission of national technical regulations prior to their adoption has continued to be an effective instrument of prevention of barriers to trade and of cooperation between the Commission and the Member States and among the Member States themselves. The notification procedure has been an important tool for guiding national regulatory activity including in certain emerging sectors and improving the quality of national technical regulations - in terms of transparency, legibility and effectiveness - in non-harmonised or partly harmonised areas. The greater clarity in the legal framework of the Member States can help economic operators to adapt to the new rules and thus reduce the cost of accessing the regulations and apply them correctly. This is possible also thanks to the fact that technical regulations notified to the Commission are translated into 23 official languages of the EU."}
{"chunk_id": 146, "doc_title": "Report on the Operation of Directive (EU) 2015-1535", "heading_2": "INTRODUCTION", "heading_3": "na", "heading_4": "na", "chunk": "INTRODUCTION\nThe notification procedure for national technical regulations allows the Commission and the Member States of the EU to examine before adoption the technical regulations Member States intend to introduce for products (industrial, agricultural and fishery) and for Information Society services (see Annex 1 of the Commission Staff Working Document accompanying this Report). It applies in a simplified manner to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) Member States which are signatories to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA) and to Switzerland and Turkey (see Annex 3).\nThe main purpose of the notification procedure is to prevent the creation of new barriers to the internal market before they have been put in place and have produced any negative effects.\nThe internal market is one of the Commission's 10 priorities and the Commission considers a better functioning Single Market as an engine for building a stronger EU economy and \"Europe’s best asset in times of increasing globalisation\". For this reason, together with the Member States the Commission endeavours to unlock the full potential of the Single Market \"so that citizens, business and public authorities can access goods and services for the best quality, price or service\". As stated in the Single Market Strategy, \"[T]he Single Market is arguably among European Union’s greatest achievements\" and the Commission considers it a priority to remove remaining regulatory and non-regulatory barriers to the Single Market for goods and services. The European Commission has decided to give the Single Market a new boost with a number of ambitious and pragmatic actions in key areas for the EU internal market such as circular economy, collaborative economy, the Digital Single Market, the Capital Market Union and taxation.\nIn its Communication \"Upgrading the Single Market: more opportunities for people and business\" the Commission has stressed that \"[g]oods generate around 75 % of intra-EU trade [and that in] 2014, trade in goods between EU Member States was valued at EUR 2 900 billion\", thus highlighting the important role played by trade in goods in the general context of trade in the Single Market (intra-EU trade in goods represented 20.6% of EU GDP in 2015). The need to strengthen the free movement of goods and to provide businesses a more predictable regulatory framework is reiterated in the Commission staff working document accompanying this Communication. The Single Market Transparency Directive contributes directly or indirectly to several follow-up initiatives of the Single Market Strategy.\nGiven the centrality of the Single Market Transparency Directive in the proper functioning of the Single Market for goods and for Information Society services, this report is adopted together with the \"Goods Package\". The aim of the package is to boost the Single Market and exploit its full potential by reinforcing trust in the Single Market for the benefit of all, citizens and business. Specifically, initiatives will be presented to make mutual recognition function better and to enhance the enforcement of common EU product safety rules.\nThe Single Market Transparency Directive is the most open and transparent instrument of the Single Market. It is a unique system which prevents the emergence of new barriers to the Single Market by putting the focus on transparency, dialogue, prevention and better regulation. Not only it provides that Member States participate on an equal footing with the Commission in this procedure, but it also enables stakeholders themselves to have access to all national technical regulations under preparation, which are translated in 23 official languages of the EU. Economic operators can therefore anticipate the creation of obstacles to trade and, by taking an active role in the notification process, can concretely prevent unnecessary and costly administrative burdens from affecting their business.\nThe Single Market Transparency Directive also plays an important role in the compliance dialogue meetings with Member States, which are part of the culture of compliance and smart enforcement work strand of the Single Market Strategy. The Commission sees these meetings as an opportunity for a dialogue to improve transposition, implementation and application of EU law. The dialogues are also an occasion to discuss together with Member States how to proactively address the challenges of EU law enforcement. In this context, the dialogue under the Single Market Transparency Directive, combined with other indicators, enables the Commission to better identify the problematic sectors and structural problems in the Member States.\nTaking into account the role of the Single Market Transparency Directive in preventing the creation of barriers on the single market of goods, in the framework of the Services Package the Commission recently presented a legislative proposal for a self standing notification instrument in the area of services. This aims to modernise the existing notification procedure under the Services Directive and will allow for more upstream verification of the justification and proportionality of new national regulations potentially restricting the free movement of services as well as addressing compliance through the dialogue with the Member States before the proposed legislation has been adopted.\nGiven its wide scope, which covers all products, industrial, agricultural and fishery, and Information Society services, the Single Market Transparency Directive also helps in promoting the free movement of goods and services in emerging sectors of the digital economy and for preventing the creation of barriers to trade in the EU Digital Single Market. The Single Market Transparency Directive notification procedure helps to create a stronger and more connected Digital Single Market. With respect to the collaborative economy, the Single Market Transparency Directive seeks to prevent the adoption by Member States of unjustified and disproportionate market access requirements."}

The cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the context of the notification procedure aims to ensure a clearer regulatory framework for economic operators.\nIn the framework of the Commission’s action plan to simplify and improve the regulatory environment, Member States have been invited to submit impact studies (or their conclusions) together with notified drafts technical regulations under the Single Market Transparency Directive, where such studies have been carried out internally. By carrying out these impact studies, Member States are encouraged to reflect in advance on the most appropriate instrument to be used, and the Commission can better check the necessity and proportionality of the measures proposed. In the reporting period, Member States submitted impact studies in relation to 356 notifications (almost 25% of the total of notifications). This represents a slight increase compared to the previous two years, when Member States submitted 314 impact studies out of 1439 notifications (approximately 22% of the total of notifications)."}

The evaluation of national regulations, before their adoption, in the light of Articles 34-36 TFEU and of the mutual recognition principle and the recommendations of the Commission to insert a single market clause clause in notified draft national rules, where necessary, helps in reducing the risk of these rules raising regulatory barriers to trade.  This preventive mechanism could be complemented by a corrective mechanism, in case authorities, when taking decisions based on national rules in individual cases, misapply the principle of mutual recognition. For this reason, the report is adopted together with the “Goods package”, which contains a Single Market Strategy follow-up initiative to give a major boost to mutual recognition in the area of goods. It aims to introduce the use by economic operators of a voluntary mutual recognition declaration and to facilitate the smooth implementation of the mutual recognition principle. This should ensure that national regulations do not create unjustified barriers to trade through their full life cycle."}
{"chunk_id": 150, "doc_title": "Report on the Operation of Directive (EU) 2015-1535", "heading_2": "Developments 2014-2015", "heading_3": "Improvements to the notification procedure", "heading_4": "na", "chunk": "Improvements to the notification procedure\nOne of the objectives of the Single Market Transparency Directive is to inform economic operators, including small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), in advance of planned technical regulation in the Member States, to allow them to make their voices heard and to adapt early their activities to future technical regulations. The high number of contributions on notifications sent by stakeholders shows that this right of scrutiny is used extensively and helps the Commission and national authorities to detect barriers to trade.\nIn an ever-evolving effort towards transparency and efficiency, in 2015 the Commission worked on a new functionality on the Technical Regulation Information System (TRIS) website. This new functionality was put in place in June 2016 and allows any person to use the TRIS website to submit contributions on any notification during the standstill period provided for under Article 6 of the Single Market Transparency Directive.\nContributors have the possibility to make their contribution confidential and available only to the Commission services. The new \"Contributions\" tool also provides a way to quickly and easily gain access to contributions from other stakeholders provided they have not been marked as confidential, giving more visibility to contributions also outside the Commission.\nAll contributions submitted through this new mechanism will be immediately forwarded to the Commission's competent services, representing an increase in the efficiency of the contribution process. In the meantime, contributors receive an automatic acknowledgement of receipt through the Contribution Acceptance receipt sent by email."}
{"chunk_id": 151, "doc_title": "Report on the Operation of Directive (EU) 2015-1535", "heading_2": "Developments 2014-2015", "heading_3": "Jurisprudence on the Single Market Transparency Directive", "heading_4": "na", "chunk": "Jurisprudence on the Single Market Transparency Directive\nIn the reference period the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) issued two main rulings referring to the Single Market Transparency Directive and its obligations which help to clarify some aspects of the Directive and to better define some of its requirements.\nIn case C-307/13 (Ivansson and Others), the Court stated that, if a change to the timetable for the implementation of a national measure is made and if this is significant in nature, the draft technical regulation is subject to the obligation of communication to the Commission, as laid down in the third subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Single Market Transparency Directive (\"Member States shall communicate the draft technical regulation again to the Commission […] if they make changes to the draft that have the effect of significantly altering its scope, shortening the timetable originally envisaged for implementation, adding specifications or requirements, or making the latter more restrictive\"). The Court added that a failure to observe such an obligation constitutes a procedural defect in the adoption of the technical regulation concerned, and renders this technical regulation inapplicable and therefore unenforceable against individuals.\nIn case C-98/14 (Berlington Hungary and Others) the Court ruled that a tax legislation such as that at issue which is not accompanied by any technical specification or any other requirement with which it is purportedly intended to ensure compliance, cannot be described as a \"de facto technical regulation\" (Article 1(f) of the Single Market Transparency Directive) and that the concept of \"de facto technical regulations\" refers, not to the tax measures themselves, but to the technical specifications or other requirements linked to them.\nThe Court also stated that the provisions of national legislation that prohibit the operation of slot machines outside casinos constitute \"technical regulations\" within the meaning of Article 1(f) of the Single Market Transparency Directive, the drafts of which must be communicated in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of the Single Market Transparency Directive. The Court held that \"a national measure which restricts the organisation of certain games of chance to casinos only constitutes a ‘technical regulation’, within the meaning of Article [1(f) of the Single Market Transparency Directive], in so far as it can significantly influence the nature or the marketing of the products used in that context\".\nThe Court also held that Articles 5 and 6 of the Single Market Transparency Directive, which illustrate the procedural steps of the notification procedure, \"are not intended to confer rights on individuals, in such a way that their infringement by a Member State gives rise to a right of individuals to obtain from that Member State compensation for the damage suffered as a result of that infringement on the basis of EU law\".\nThese judgements provided better clarity on the interpretation of Articles 1, 5 and 6 of the Single Market Transparency Directive and notably on the notification of changes to previously notified laws, the concept of technical regulation and the fact that procedural breaches do not give rise to compensation claims. This will help Member States and the Commission in better applying the Single Market Transparency Directive."}

{"chunk_id": 153, "doc_title": "Report on the Operation of Directive (EU) 2015-1535", "heading_2": "Developments 2014-2015", "heading_3": "Effectiveness: general overview", "heading_4": "na", "chunk": "Effectiveness: general overview\n► Volume of notifications and sectors involved\nFrom 2014 to 2015, the Commission received 1382 notifications (655 in 2014, 727 in 2015). This represents a small decrease with respect to the previous two years (1484 notifications).\nMarked differences in the number of notifications among Member States have been noticed, with some Member States carrying out on average more than 50 notifications per year and others notifying less than 10 notifications per year. If this gap can be partly explained with a different setting of the State organisation (e.g. presence of regional/local authorities with regulatory powers), lack of awarness or with a higher/lower degree of regulatory activity, this wide discrepancy raises doubts about the full compliance with the notification obligations by some Member States. This can also be explained by the fact that some national regulatory authorities do not take into account the Single Market Transparency Directive notification process, and notably the required stand-still of three months, when planning their regulatory decision making process.\nA correlation between the size of the Member States and the number of notifications can be observed, with the biggest Member States notifying, in general, more than the medium and small ones. This can be partly explained with a higher number of regional and local authorities  which have an obligation to notify their draft technical regulations. However, this is not always the case: for instance, in some cases medium-sized Member States notified more than some bigger Member States.\nAs in the previous reporting period, the construction sector saw the highest number of notifications over the reporting period. Many measures related to energy efficiency of buildings and concrete structures, road pavements and constituent materials, and fire safety of buildings.\nLike in the previous reporting period, this sector was again followed by notifications in the area of agricultural products, fishery and aquaculture products and other foodstuffs. In this category, several measures concerned food hygiene, the composition and labelling of foodstuffs and beverages, food packaging, minimum price for alcoholic beverages, composition and marketing of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, quality and origin marks.\nNumerous notifications were also made in the telecommunications sector (radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment, radio interfaces, hardware and software for the collection, management and use of data gathered by electronic mechanisms installed on board vehicles (black box)).\nA number of notifications concerned gambling products and services.\nFinally, a number of notifications related to the environment sector (mainly packaging and packaging waste, recyclable products, processing of biodegradable waste) (see Annex 2.3).\n► Issues addressed by the Commission in its reactions\nIn the non-harmonised areas which, in absence of secondary legislation, are subject to compliance with Articles 34 to 36 (free movement of goods) and 49 and 56 (right of establishment and freedom to provide services) TFEU, the Commission’s reactions were intended to draw Member States’ attention to potential obstacles to trade after assessing the necessity and the proportionality of the measure in line with the case-law of the Court of Justice. Thus the Commission aimed to ensure compliance with these principles and in addition continued to invite Member States to insert mutual recognition clauses into each draft technical regulation falling outside the harmonised area.\nWhen national measures partially fall under harmonised areas, the reactions were intended to ensure that national measures were compatible with EU secondary legislation.\nIn 2014-2015 Member States notified 303 (151 in 2014 and 152 in 2015) draft technical regulations in the field of construction. These drafts concerned all types of construction products, inter alia, bridge structures and concrete road structures, pitched roof coverings for buildings, fire-fighting and rescue equipment, thermal insulation, synthetic fill materials, concrete structures, electrical installations on and in concrete structures, metallic materials in contact with drinking water.\nIn particular, the Commission examined draft technical regulations setting additional technical requirements or tests for construction products impeding the free movement of products labelled with the CE mark. The notified drafts were examined principally under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products and repealing Council Directive 89/106/EEC.\nThe Commission examined draft legislation prohibiting the installation of fossil oil furnaces and natural gas furnaces in new buildings except when oil and gas furnaces use only renewable energy. The notified draft was examined under Directive 2009/142/EC on gas appliances (GAD) and Directive 92/42/EEC on efficiency requirements for new hot-water boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels.\nTechnical regulations relating to energy efficiency of buildings were assessed under Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive 2009/125/EC establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products.\nThe Commission also examinded draft legislation concerning requirements for motorway communications equipment. The notified draft was examined under Directive 1999/5/EC, Directive 2006/95/EC and Directive 2004/108/EC.\nIn the agricultural, fishery and foodstuff sectors, from 2014 to 2015 Member States notified 266 (133 in 2014 and 133 in 2015) draft technical regulations. These drafts concerned, inter alia, materials coming into contact with foodstuffs, energy drinks, trans fats in food products, wine and spirits, quality marks for foodstuffs, the well-being of animals and the marketing of fur products.\nCertain Member States notified draft regulations setting up marks linking the quality of a product with its origin. These notifications have been examined under the Treaty provisions on the free movement of goods and Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and the Council on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs.\nDuring the relevant period, the Commission examined many notifications concerning the hygiene of foodstuffs and issued detailed opinions and comments concerning their compliance with Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption.\nOther notifications concerned the labelling of foodstuff and the Commission assessed their compatibility with Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers, in particular with the provisions on nutritional declarations, or other sector-specific provisions on consumer information.\nIn the Information Society services sector there were 69 (25 in 2014 and 44 in 2015) notifications. Numerous notifications were in the area of gambling, while others concerned, inter alia, copyright in the digital environment, on demand audio-visual media services, electronic commerce, electronic signature and other trust services.\nIn the metrology sector there were 67 notifications (37 in 2014 and 30 in 2015). These drafts concerned various types of measuring devices such as gas, electricity and heat meters, taximeters or prism refractometers and provided for specific requirements which these instruments have to fulfil. The notifications on gas, electricity and heat meters and taximeters were mainly analysed under Directive 2004/22/EC on measuring instruments. The novelty consisted of projects of new smart metering systems, also falling under Directive 2004/22/EC, which are quite complex due to the needs of the combination of engineering with IT and communication, data privacy and security aspects.\nIn the chemicals sector the Commission received 69 (33 in 2014 and 36 in 2015) notifications. The bulk of the notifications concerned biocidal products, fertilisers, plant protection products and products falling under the scope of REACH and were mainly examined under Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (\"REACH\"), the Biocidal Products Regulation and Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market.\nIn the environmental sector the Commission examined 86 (42 in 2014 and 44 in 2015) draft regulations. Some notified drafts concerned packaging waste and raised both problems of compatibility with the EU harmonised legislation, particularly Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (for example with regard to the requirements for banning lightweight plastic carrier bags), and with Articles 34-36 TFEU, for the non-harmonised aspects (for instance with regard to the mutual recognition clause or the use of national standards for disposable plastic bags or disposable plastic cups, glasses and plates).\nThe notification procedure has also allowed the Commission to intervene in sectors where harmonisation was envisaged or under way at European Union level and thus has prevented Member States from introducing divergent national measures. Pursuant to Articles 6(3) and 6(4) of the Single Market Transparency Directive, the Commission has requested the notifying Member State to postpone the adoption of notified draft legislation for twelve months from the date of notification in the fields of: electronic signatures, electronic archiving, electronic recorded delivery, electronic time-stamping and certification services (notification 2013/584/B and 2013/585/B) and requirements for milk and milk products, ice creams and edible fats and oils (notification 2015/169/CZ).\nThus, the Single Market Transparency Directive helps to avoid the fragmentation of the Single Market in areas where harmonisation is envisaged or under way and aims to give greater certainty and stability in the legal framework to the economic operators.\n► Positive examples, showcasing the impact of the Single Market Transparency Directive\nIn 2014 the Commission issued a detailed opinion on an Italian notification concerning a regional logo which linked the origin of a wide range of products with their quality. The Commission argued that this measure would have been contrary to Article 34 TFEU as it could have encouraged consumers to buy national products to the detriment of imported ones. Following a dialogue, the Italian authorities removed the barrier by eliminating the reference to the origin of the products covered by the notified draft.\nIn 2014 Hungary notified a draft measure setting inspections to ensure that operators have paid VAT on wine products without geographical indication marketed in Hungary. These inspections were subject to the payment of a fee. The Commission issued a detailed opinion arguing that the payment of a VAT inspection fee was contrary to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products. Following the adoption of the measure by the Hungarian authorities, the Commission started an investigation which was finally closed due to the fact that the contested measure ceased to have effect from 31 July 2017 (due to lack of extension by the Hungarian authorities). The notification procedure, therefore, proved useful in the identification of a barrier to trade which was eventually removed through an investigation.\nIn 2015 the French authorities notified the Commission a draft measure defining a logotype to be used with industrial and craft products protected by geographical indications. The Commission issued a detailed opinion on the grounds that establishing the logotype, which consisted of a blue and red outline around the initials \"IG\" [indication géographique – geographical indication], with the word \"FRANCE\", was liable to constitute a measure having equivalent effect under Article 34 TFEU. In particular, the Commission considered that this logotype underlining the French origin of the products concerned would go beyond the objective of authenticating the specific local or regional origin of a product and could therefore encourage consumers to purchase products bearing this logo, to the exclusion of products from other Member States. The French authorities took these objections on board and amended the draft logotype in a manner with was consider acceptable by the Commission.\nIn 2015 France notified a draft technical regulation setting out the expected performance of personal protective equipment (PPE) used to protect operators and workers from synthesised plant protection products and proposed appropriate tests. The Commission issued a detailed opinion expressing its concerns on the mutual recognition clause contained in the notified draft. According to the notified draft, any other means could be used to demonstrate that suits comply with the essential health and safety requirements of Council Directive 89/686/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to personal protective equipment (PPP Directive), provided that these means guaranteed the same level of protection for operators and workers as the test conditions and information requirements described in the French draft. The Commission was of the opinion that this provision rendered in practice the test conditions and information requirements of the notified text mandatory, in breach of Article 4(1) of the PPE Directive: \"Member States may not prohibit, restrict or hinder the placing on the market of PPE or PPE components which comply with the provisions of this Directive and which bear the CE marking attesting their conformity to all the provisions of this Directive, including the certification procedures in Chapter II\". The French authorities modified the text accordingly, addressing the concerns expressed by the Commission.\nIn 2014 the United Kingdom notified a draft providing that motorway communications equipment should comply with the Low Voltage Directive (LVD), the Radio & Telecommunication Terminal Equipment Directive (R&TTE), and the Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive (EMC), and, in addition, with a number of harmonised voluntary standards. The Commission issued a detailed opinion reminding that if products fall within the scope of specific EU harmonising legislation providing for the CE marking (such as the LVD, EMC, R&TTE), they shall comply with that legislation and shall not be subject to those provisions of the notified draft that regulate the same risks. The United Kingdom modified the draft by removing any requirement to comply with voluntary harmonised standards under CE marking directives throughout the notified draft.\n► Most common tackled barriers\nOne of the purposes of the Single Market Transparency Directive is to allow the identification of areas of recurrent obstacles to the free movement of goods and the freedom to provide Information Society services and the detection of harmonisation needs with the aim of ensuring a smoother functioning of the single market.\nIn this respect, the Commission identified in the period under analysis several recurrent barriers in the notified draft legislation, of which the most pertinent ones are listed below..\nMutual recognition clauses\nThe Commission reacted frequently to notifications of draft technical regulations in which the mutual recognition clause was not included or was not drafted in line with the standard laid down in the \"Interpretative Communication on facilitating the access of products to the markets of other Member States: the practical application of mutual recognition\" (2003/C 265/02). Some Member States justified the absence of the mutual recognition clause in their drafts on the basis of the inclusion of a general mutual recognition clause in the basic legislation. In those cases, the Commission nonetheless recommended to the notifying Member States to include in the notified drafts a direct reference to the mutual recognition clause in the basic legislation in order to ensure the necessary legal certainty for business operators.\nImproper legal drafting technique - Repetition of provisions of EU Regulations\nOne of the most frequent issues addressed by the Commission in the detailed opinions issued on the basis of EU regulations applicable in the food hygiene area, was a practice whereby the notified draft technical regulations repeated, often partially and in an incomplete way, the provisions laid down in the applicable EU regulations. According to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, a regulation has general application, is binding in its entirety and is directly applicable in all Member States (Article 288 TFEU). Thus, Member States may not lay down rules in the area governed by directly applicable EU legislation, even identical ones, as they would interfere with the correct application of the EU legislation and cause uncertainty as to the complete application of the relevant EU law.\nIncorrect implementation of the exemptions provided for in the food hygiene regulations\nSeveral potential breaches have also been identified in respect of the implementation by the notifying Member States of the exceptions and the flexibility clauses contained in the three Regulations (e.g. Article 1(3) and (5) and Article 10(3) of Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin). Member States wrongly implemented or went beyond what is allowed by these exemptions.\nUnjustified barriers related to Information Society services\nIn the area of Information Society services the Commission identified recurrent problems in notified drafts concerning gambling. These led to the issuance of 14 detailed opinions (6 in 2014 and 8 in 2015) the main grounds of which concerned unjustified or disproportionate restrictions to the free provision of services and freedom of establishment under Articles 49 and 56 TFEU. For example, the Commission made remarks concerning the conditions for granting the monopoly and licenses to gambling operators, the establishment requirements in a given Member State of the service provider or of its ICT infrastructure or regarding the blocking of websites.\nOther recurring issues in the detailed opinions concerning gambling related to the compliance with the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC, restrictions to the free movement of goods (Article 34-36 TFEU) and breach of product–related secondary legislation such as Regulation (EC) No 765/2008 on marketing of products, accreditation and market surveillance, the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC, Directive 1999/5/EC on radio equipment and telecommunications terminal equipment, Directive 2014/30/EU on Electromagnetic Compatibility and the Low Voltage Directive 2014/35/EU. For example, the Commission raised concerns regarding requiring CE marking, assessment by conformity assessment bodies or non-recognition of foreign conformity assessment bodies.\nStandards – making them mandatory, requring additional test methods\nAnother recurring issue is a practice whereby national legislation seeks to make voluntary European harmonised standards compulsory by inserting them into national law.\nIn this context, under the New Approach directives, only \"essential requirements\" listed in the harmonising Directives are mandatory. European harmonised standards are one of the ways of guaranteeing the presumption of conformity with the mandatory essential requirements and should thus remain voluntary.\nThis practice by the Member States would create barriers to trade within the internal market since products complying with the essential requirements of New Approach Directives but not with the European harmonised standards, could not freely circulate in the Member State in question.\nMoreover, some Member States intended to develop and to require additional (non-standardised) test methods to those provided for by harmonised standards while, additional national methods cannot be imposed by Member States in the light of the case law of the CJEU as well as primary and secondary EU legislation. National (even voluntary) procedures linked to the verification/testing of characteristics not harmonised in harmonised standards are therefore not allowed.\nAll of the above-mentioned recurrent practices have been discussed with the Member States in the framework of the Standing Committee of Technical Regulations, which meets twice per year. In addition, these recurrent practices will be also discussed in the context of bilateral compliance meetings with the Member States.\n► Reactions\nThe Single Market Transparency Directive allows for a formal and structured exchange of information between the Members States and the Commission and among Members States to take place when assessing notified drafts. The intensity of this exchange of information is demonstrated by the high number of reactions sent by the Commission and the Member States to the notifications and by the replies of the notifying Member States and the subsequent exchange of messages. Thanks to this exchange of information, the Member States have also the possibility to ascertain the degree of compatibility of notified drafts with European Union legislation. When necessary, the Commission's services also meet at expert level with representatives of the Member States to clarify outstanding issues. The Commission can also send to the Member States requests for supplementary information in order to clarify the scope of the notified technical regulations.\nThe intensity of this dialogue is showed in the table below which indicates the number of notifications per Member State for each year of the period considered and the comments and detailed opinion issued by the Commission regarding those notifications.\nIn the period considered the Commission issued 141 detailed opinions (60 from 2014, 81 from 2015), which represents 10.2% of the total number of drafts notified by the Member States over the reporting period. This figure shows a 10% decrease in the number of detailed opinions issued by the Commission compared to the previous two years. For their part, the Member States  issued 131 detailed opinions (64 from 2014 and 67 from 2015), which represents a decrease compared to the previous two years (157 detailed opinions). Of the 589 comments issued during the reporting period (634 had been issued in the previous two years), 352 were made by the Commission (161 in 2014 and 191 in 2015) and 237 by the Member States (112 in 2014 and 125 in relation to notifications from 2015) (see Annexes 2.4 and 2.6).\nThe table below shows the number of reactions (comments and detailed opinions) issued by each Member State in the reporting period. The numbers in the table provide some indications on the participation of Member States in the dialogue triggered by the notification and on the specific interests of some Member States whose reactions are more contentrated in specific sectors. Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain and the United Kingdom are among the most active Member States. An analysis of the reactions per Member State and by sector shows a particular interest of Austria, France, Italy, Slovakia and Spain for the agriculture, fishery and foodstuffs sector; of Germany for the telecoms sector; of Poland for the mechanics sector; and of Malta for the domestic and leisure equipment sector (mostly linked with gambling machines).\nThanks to the access to all notifications and to the messages exchanged within the dialogues, Member States can use the Single Market Transparency Directive as a benchmarking tool. It allows them to draw on the ideas of their partners in order to solve common problems regarding technical regulations and to identify when a draft technical regulation could be in breach of EU law.\nIn 3 cases, the Commission invited the Member States concerned to postpone the adoption of the notified regulations for one year from the date of their receipt, because there was European Union harmonisation work under way in the area (see Annex 2.5)."}

As a result, use of the urgency procedure was refused for cases in which the justification was not sufficiently established or was based on purely economic grounds or national administrative delay as well as in cases for which no unforeseeable circumstances were demonstrated. The urgency procedure was deemed justified in 60 cases (29 in 2014 and 31 cases in 2015), in particular concerning psychotropic substances, control of narcotics, medicinal products, fight against terrorism, firearms, pesticides, infection of bees, prohibition of products that are harmful to health and fireworks (see Annex 2.7)."}

The Commission observes that often national legislation is misclassified as \"fiscal or financial measure\" in the meaning of the Single Market Transparency Directive when it contains any fiscal or financial measures but not the incentive to comply with such technical regulations.

In 12 cases (7 in 2014 and 5 in 2015) the withdrawal followed the delivery of a reaction (detailed opinion or comments) by the Commission. Some of the reasons of these withdrawals are, inter alia, the introduction by the notifying Member State of substantial changes to the draft technical regulation which require a new notification (Article 5(1) of the Single Market Transparency Directive) or the simple decision of the national authorities not to go ahead with the adoption of the draft technical regulation.\nFor other notified draft technical regulations the dialogue is still on-going."}

For all these cases, the Commission drew the attention of the national authorities to their duty to notify and to respect the standstill period provided for in Article 6(2) of the Single Market Transparency Directive. The Commission recalled that the CJEU held that the adoption of technical regulations in breach of \"the obligation to notify constitutes a substantial procedural defect such as to render the technical regulations in question inapplicable to individuals\". Consequently, individuals can resort to national courts which \"must decline to apply a national technical regulation which has not been notified in accordance with the directive\" (Case C-194/94 CIA Security International, paragraphs 44, 48 and 54; Case-226/97 Lemmens, paragraph 33; Case C-303/04 Lidl Italia, paragraphs 23, 24)."}

A higher number of notifications and a more active participation of Member States in the procedure would favour the prevention of new technical barriers and the identification of systemic issues in each Member State and across the EU. This would help the dialogue with the Commission and would facilitate a more targeted and effective approach to barriers to intra-EU trade.\nThe high number of detailed opinions and comments issued during the reporting period demonstrates that there is an increasing risk of fragmentation of the internal market for goods. On average 79% of the detailed opinions issued by the Commission were replied to by the Member States concerned and dialogues followed to remove any incompatibility with EU law, thus avoiding infringement procedures.\nThe importance of the Single Market Transparency Directive is proved by the high interest of stakeholders in the notification procedure, as noted, inter alia, in the REFIT Platform opinion on the Directive. This growing interest mirrors the effort to improve the transparency and the efficiency of the TRIS public website.\nThe notification procedure has also confirmed its usefulness in providing the possibility to identify areas where harmonisation at EU level might be an option.\nWhen applying the Single Market Transparency Directive the Commission remains vigilant regarding the principle of better regulation and the need to sustain a favourable environment for the competitiveness of the European economy.

Further promotion of the Single Market Transparency Directive and its stronger implementation together with a stronger link with follow-up policy and legislative actions are crucial in order to fully achieve its objectives."}

It analyses the results of the application of one of the cornerstones of the single market from 2016 to 2020: the notification procedure laid down by the Single Market Transparency Directive. The report highlights the notification procedure’s important contribution to the functioning of the single market and to implementing the Better Regulation guidelines and toolbox, as well as its pivotal role during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNotifying the Commission of national technical regulations before their adoption has continued to be an important tool to address the emergence of barriers to trade, with the aim to prevent them.  It has also continued to be a good channel to ensure cooperation between the Commission and the Member States and among the Member States themselves. This is particularly important in critical and unforeseen circumstances such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, technical regulations are notified to the Commission and the final texts of the notified measures are translated into 23 official languages of the EU.\nAdditionally, the implementation of the Single Market Transparency Directive requires the Commission to follow up and monitor all notifications raising concerns as to their compatibility with EU law. In that context, the Commission pays particular attention to measures having the highest impact on the single market.\nINTRODUCTION\nAs ‘an engine for building a stronger and fairer EU economy’,  the single market is a key part of the Commission’s six priorities for 2019-2024. The single market has improved prosperity and opportunities for businesses and the public in Europe. A well-functioning single market stimulates competition and trade, improves efficiency, raises quality and helps reduce prices for businesses and consumers.\nAs part of the Commission’s March 2020 new industry strategy package, a communication on barriers and an action plan on single market enforcement were adopted to further improve competitiveness and facilite the integration of companies of all sizes in EU and global value chains. Action 10 of the Commission action plan on single market enforcement refers to the Single Market Transparency Directive. In that context, ‘in line with the more strategic approach for the Commission’s enforcement actions, the implementation of the Single Market Transparency Directive is built on four axes:\nMember States notify to the Commission all draft technical regulations  concerning  goods and information  society  services;\nthe Commission follows up on all notifications raising concerns as to the their  compatibility  with  EU  law;\nin  calibrating its follow-up, the Commission pays particular attention to  measures  having  the  highest  impact on the single market;\nthe Commission monitors legislation which was subject to a Commission reaction  under the Single Market Transparency Directive and which, in the absence of appropriate adjustments, may give rise to infringement proceedings’.\nThe Commission puts a clear focus on prevention and enforcement in relation to cases with the most significant impact on the single market economically or in some other way.\nThe Single Market Transparency Directive aims to prevent the emergence of new barriers in the single market by focusing on transparency, dialogue, prevention and better regulation. Member States can participate on an equal footing with the Commission in this procedure. Stakeholders have access to both national technical regulations under preparation and the final texts of the notified measures, translated in 23 official languages of the EU. Therefore, economic operators can anticipate the creation of obstacles to trade and avoid unnecessary and costly administrative burdens affecting their business.\nThe notification procedure for national technical regulations under the Single Market Transparency Directive allows the Commission and the Member States to examine, before their adoption, the technical regulations any Member State intends to introduce for products (industrial, agricultural and fishery) and information society services (see Annex 1 to the Commission staff working document accompanying this report). The procedure applies in a simplified manner to European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states which are parties to the Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA), to Switzerland, and to Turkey (see Annex 4).\nThe Single Market Transparency Directive also plays a key role in the ‘country knowledge’ dialogue meetings with Member States and stakeholders. Such meetings are part of the single market strategy’s efforts to ensure a culture of compliance and smart enforcement. The Commission sees these meetings as an opportunity for dialogue to improve the implementation of the Single Market Transparency Directive. In this context, the dialogue under the Directive, combined with other indicators, enables the Commission to better identify the problematic sectors and structural problems in the Member States.\nThis report drafted and submitted in compliance with the Single Market Transparency Directive is a snapshot of its operation from 2016 to 2020 both from a qualitative and quantitative angle.\nIn 2020, the notification procedure under the Single Market Transparency Directive played a crucial role in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and contributed to a coordinated approach to the health crisis throughout the EU. The spread of the virus caused the disruption of global supply chains. During the pandemic, the integrity of the single market and, more broadly, the preservation of production and distribution value chains ensuring the necessary supplies to our health systems were jeopardised. The Directive provided a framework allowing Member States to act in a coordinated way.\n1.\tDevelopments 2016-2020\nWith 3 553 notifications received in the 5-year period 2016-2020 (see Annex 3.1), the dialogue that unfolded in the context of the Single Market Transparency Directive demonstrated a good level of participation by the Member States, which issued 243 detailed opinions and 475 comments (see Annex 3.6). This was coupled with frequent reactions by the Commission on the notified technical regulations, notably 212 detailed opinions and 816 comments issued by the Commission (see Annex 3.4). The highest number of reactions of the Commission and the EU Member States concerned agriculture, fishing and foodstuffs and construction products.\nThe introduction of new IT tools over the reference period, as described in the paragraphs below, facilitated economic operators’ participation in the Single Market Transparency Directive procedure.\nThe case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) shed light on some interpretative conundrums of the Single Market Transparency Directive. These included the definition of technical regulations, the classification of new intermediation services in emerging sectors related to collaborative economy models, the right of access to documents in relation to the Single Market Transparency Directive procedure and the penalty for non-notification."}

This allows economic operators to make their voices heard and to adapt their activities in good time to future technical regulations. The high number of contributions on notifications sent by stakeholders shows that this right of scrutiny is exercised extensively and is helping the Commission and national authorities to detect barriers to trade.\nIn an ever-evolving effort towards transparency and efficiency, in 2015 the Commission worked to develop a new function on the Technical Regulation Information System (TRIS) website. This function was put in place in 2016 and allows any person to use the TRIS website to submit contributions on any notification during the standstill period provided for under Article 6 of the Single Market Transparency Directive. From 2016-2020, the Commission received 1 618 contributions via this function (144 in 2016, 421 in 2017, 175 in 2018, 281 in 2019 and 597 in 2020)."}

The cooperation between the Commission and the Member States within the context of the notification procedure aims to ensure a clearer regulatory framework for economic operators.\nThe Single Market Transparency Directive also contributes to better mutual recognition. The mutual recognition principle, which derives from the case-law of the CJEU on Articles 34 to 36 TFEU, ensures market access for goods that are not, or are only partly, subject to EU harmonisation legislation. It guarantees that any good lawfully marketed in one Member State can in principle be sold in another. The assessment of national regulations before their adoption helps minimise the risk that these rules raise unjustified regulatory barriers to trade, notably in the light of the mutual recognition principle. This is because the Commission can: (i) correct the text of the single market clauses in drafts notified by the Member States under the Single Market Transparency Directive procedure; and (ii) recommend that the Member States insert the single market clause in notified draft national measures when it is missing in the notified drafts.\n2.\tApplication of the notification procedure"}

While this gap can be partly explained with reference to the way the state organisation is structured in different countries (e.g. presence of regional/local authorities with regulatory powers), by lack of awareness or by a higher/lower degree of regulatory activity, this wide discrepancy raised doubts as to whether there has been full compliance with the notification obligations. Analysis showed that in 2017, 2018 and 2019 almost all Member States did not notify nor re-notify draft technical regulations. However, the vast majority of Member States had relatively low numbers of non-notified drafts, equal to or below 10 per year.\nA correlation between the size of the Member States and the number of notifications can be observed in Annex 3.2 (Table 1), with the biggest Member States notifying in general more than the medium-sized and small ones. This can be partly explained by a higher number of regional and local authorities that have an obligation to notify their draft technical regulations. However, this is not always the case: for instance, in some cases, medium-sized Member States notified more than certain bigger Member States and bigger Member States with a centralised structure notified more than Member States with a decentralised structure.\nAs in the previous reporting period, the highest number of notifications over 2016-2020 concerned the construction sector, followed by the notifications in the area of agricultural products, fishery, aquaculture and other foodstuffs.\nNumerous notifications were also made in the area of information society services, in the environmental and chemical sectors (mainly on packaging and packaging waste, plastic products, fertilisers, plant protection products containing glyphosate or neonicotinoids, emission standards, cosmetic products containing microplastics) and transport (e.g. on electric vehicles, special equipment for passenger vehicles and taxis, snow mobiles, e-scooters, ships and recreational craft, drones) (see Annex 3.3)."}

These drafts concerned all types of construction products, including bridge structures and concrete road structures, pitched roof coverings for buildings, fire-fighting and rescue equipment, thermal insulation, synthetic fill materials, concrete structures, electrical installations on and in concrete structures, and metallic materials in contact with drinking water.\nIn particular, the Commission examined draft technical regulations setting additional technical requirements or tests for construction products impeding the free movement of products labelled with the CE mark. The notified drafts were examined mainly under Regulation (EU) No 305/2011 laying down harmonised conditions for the marketing of construction products.\nThe Commission examined draft legislation prohibiting the installation of fossil oil furnaces and natural gas furnaces in new buildings except when oil and gas furnaces use only renewable energy. The notified draft was examined under Directive 2009/142/EC on gas appliances (GAD) and Directive 92/42/EEC on efficiency requirements for new hot-water boilers fired with liquid or gaseous fuels.\nTechnical regulations relating to buildings’ energy efficiency were assessed under Directive 2012/27/EU on energy efficiency, Directive 2010/31/EU on the energy performance of buildings and Directive 2009/125/EC establishing a framework for the setting of ecodesign requirements for energy-related products.\nThe Commission also assessed draft legislation concerning requirements for motorway communications equipment. The draft notified was examined under Directives 1999/5/EC, 2006/95/EC and 2004/108/EC.\nOn agricultural products, fishery, aquaculture and other foodstuffs, from 2016 to 2020 Member States notified 693 draft technical regulations (145 in 2016, 106 in 2017, 146 in 2018, 161 in 2019 and 135 in 2020). The areas covered by these drafts included, for instance, materials coming into contact with foodstuffs, energy drinks, trans fats in food products, wine and spirits, quality marks for foodstuffs, the well-being of animals and the marketing of fur products.\nCertain Member States notified draft regulations setting up marks linking the quality of a product with its origin. These notifications were examined under the TFEU provisions on the free movement of goods and Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs.\nDuring the relevant period, the Commission examined notifications concerning the hygiene of foodstuffs and issued detailed opinions and comments concerning their compliance with Regulation (EC) No 852/2004 on the hygiene of foodstuffs, Regulation (EC) No 853/2004 laying down specific hygiene rules for food of animal origin and Regulation (EC) No 854/2004 laying down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption.\nOther notifications concerned the labelling of foodstuffs. The Commission assessed their compatibility with Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on the provision of food information to consumers, in particular with the provisions on nutritional declarations, or other sector-specific provisions on consumer information.\nIn the information society services sector, Member States notified 255 measures (58 in 2016, 43 in 2017, 34 in 2018, 57 in 2019 and 63 in 2020), with the bulk of notifications concerning draft legislation affecting electronic commerce, social media and online platform operators, net neutrality and media pluralism, fake news and online hate speech, as well as other rules on information society services falling within the scope of Directive 2000/31/EC (‘the e-Commerce Directive’) and rules related to audiovisual media services falling within the scope of Directive (EU) 2018/1808 (the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive).\nOther Commission reactions were issued in relation to notified draft measures concerning rules on information society services focusing on electronic identification and trust services falling under the scope of Regulation (EU) 910/2014 (the ‘eIDAS Regulation’) and the free flow of non-personal data as regulated under Regulation (EU) 2018/1807. There were also notifications on digital data privacy, cybersecurity, data retention, electronic invoicing, copyright, telecom and electronic communications (including 5 G), safer internet for kids, e-books, online gambling and in several cases linked, in explicit or in ancillary terms, to the free movement of services and freedom of establishment (Articles 49 and 56 TFEU, as well as the Services Directive), to consumer rights under Directive 2011/83/EU, to the protection of personal data under the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and to the freedom of expression and the freedom to conduct a business as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.\nIn the chemicals sector, the Commission received 167 notifications (32 in 2016, 32 in 2017, 28 in 2018, 27 in 2019 and 48 in 2020), regarding areas such as biocidal products, plant protection products and products falling within the scope of Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (‘REACH’), which were mainly examined under the Biocidal Products Regulation, Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and under REACH.\nIn the environmental sector, the Commission examined 206 draft measures (55 in 2016, 39 in 2017, 28 in 2018, 33 in 2019 and 51 in 2020). Some notified drafts concerned packaging waste and disposable plastic products and raised problems of compatibility with Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste (for example with regard to the requirements for banning lightweight plastic carrier bags) and Directive (EU) 2019/904 on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment (for example as regards the definitions of ‘plastic’).\nThe notification procedure also allowed the Commission to intervene in sectors where harmonisation was envisaged or under way at EU level and thus prevented Member States from introducing divergent national measures. Pursuant to Articles 6(3) and 6(4) of the Single Market Transparency Directive, the Commission requested the notifying Member States to postpone the adoption of notified draft technical regulations for 12 months from the date of notification in the fields of organic production of plants, animals and aquaculture products and foodstuffs (notification 2018/190/BG), organic production of rabbit meat (notification 2018/219/E), organic broiler quails (notification 2018/666/F) and disposable plastic products (notifications 2018/665/B and 2019/9/UK)."}

A case in point was the notification concerning a draft decree obliging car drivers residing in Italy and transporting with them children under 4 years of age to use specific car seat reminder alarm devices that prevent minors from being left behind in the vehicle. In its detailed opinion, the Commission pointed out that several requirements of the notified draft were in conflict with EU harmonisation rules and with the free movement of goods (Articles 34-36 TFEU). This was due to the lack of evidence for: (i) the proportionality of the requirement concerning the prior approval procedure for car seat reminder alarm devices lawfully manufactured in other Member States; and (ii) the obligation to equip those devices with an automatic communication system for sending messages or calls via mobile wireless communication networks to at least three different phone numbers. The Commission highlighted that the ‘prior authorisation procedure’ obliging ‘accredited bodies’ to apply for recognition to the Italian Directorate-General for Motor Vehicles could be in conflict with the principle of free provision of services within the Union (Article 56 TFEU). The Italian authorities redrafted the proposed decree according to the Commission’s remarks, while ensuring that the notified draft measure could attain the objective of children’s safety.\nSimilarly, in 2016, 2017 and 2018, the Commission received several notifications concerning the characteristics and specific equipment of unmanned aircraft (drones). In its reactions, the Commission recalled the ongoing harmonisation process at EU level and invited the Member States concerned to cooperate to establish an EU regulatory framework applicable to unmanned aircraft which would ensure a high level of safety with regard to the operation of such aircraft and make it possible to manage the associated risks relating to safety, the protection of privacy and of personal data. The Member States concerned complied with the Commission’s recommendations, as expressed in the comments and detailed opinions, or withdrew the notified drafts.\nIn 2020, at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, some  Member  States  adopted  or  prepared national  measures  affecting  the  free movement of  personal  protective equipment such as protective glasses, facemasks, gloves, surgical overalls and gowns, and the free movement of medicines. These measures risked preventing such essential goods from  reaching those who needed them most, notably healthcare workers, field intervention teams and patients in affected areas all across Europe. They created domino effects, with Member States taking measures to mitigate the impact of measures taken by other Member States. In a  short time span, restrictions spread to an increasing range of products, starting with  personal protective equipment and extending to medicines. Such measures disrupted logistics and distribution chains and encouraged stockpiling responses in the supply chain. Ultimately, such measures reintroduced internal borders at a time where solidarity between Member States was the most needed. The Commission urged Member States to notify such measures via the Single Market Transparency Directive mechanism and provided guidance on how to do this. The measures notified to the Commission were assessed as a matter of high priority and the Commission supported Member States in correcting those measures that could have hindered the free movement of essential goods in the single market. The experience of the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated the relevance of the Single Market Transparency Directive procedures, including the urgency procedure (see paragraph 2.2), while it also offered useful lessons for future tackling of adverse single market effects caused by emergency situations. Where the measures were notified after their adoption, as was the case for approximately 150 COVID-19-related notifications in 2020, the notification mechanism offered by the Directive meant that the information and peer-review benefits could still be harnessed during the crisis thanks to the TRIS communication platform, where Member States could get acquainted with the COVID measures adopted by other Member States."}

In the period under analysis, the Commission identified several recurrent barriers in the notified draft measures. These included the lack of the single market clause, misleading and unclear provisions that could have been interpreted and applied as market restrictions or repetition of provisions of EU regulations, the issue of mandatory standards, and additional test methods."}
{"chunk_id": 170, "doc_title": "Report on the Operation of Single Market Transparency", "heading_2": "Effectiveness: general overview", "heading_3": "► Reactions", "heading_4": "na", "chunk": "► Reactions\nThe Single Market Transparency Directive allows for a formal and structured exchange of information between the Member States and the Commission and among Member States, when assessing notified drafts. The intensity of this exchange of information is proven by the high number of reactions sent by the Commission and the Member States to the notifications and by the replies of the notifying Member States and subsequent exchange of messages (see Annexes 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and 3.8). This exchange of information provides the Member States with the possibility to ascertain the degree of compatibility of the notified drafts with EU legislation. The Commission met regularly at expert level during the reporting period with representatives of the Member States to clarify outstanding issues, when necessary, and requested supplementary information from Member States to clarify the scope of notified technical regulations.\nIn the period considered, the Commission issued 212 detailed opinions (60 in 2016, 34 in 2017, 40 in 2018, 38 in 2019 and 40 in 2020), which represent 5.9% of the total number of drafts notified by the Member States over the reporting period. For their part, the Member States issued 243 detailed opinions (78 in 2016, 44 in 2017, 38 in 2018,  30 in 2019 and 53 in 2020). Out of the 1 291 comments issued during the reporting period, 816 were made by the Commission (154 in 2016, 189 in 2017, 184 in 2018, 155 in 2019 and 134 in 2020) and 475 by the Member States (118 in 2016, 74 in 2017, 77 in 2018, 64 in 2019 and 142 in 2020) (see Annexes 3.4 and 3.6). In five cases, the Commission invited the Member States concerned to postpone adoption of the notified technical regulations for 1 year from the date of their receipt, because there was EU harmonisation work announced or under way in the area covered by the notified drafts (see Annex 3.5).\nLooking by sector at the number of reactions (comments, detailed opinions and Commission decisions to postpone adoption of a draft) issued by each Member State and the Commission in the reporting period, we can gain further insight into the Member States’ participation in the dialogue triggered by the notifications and on the specific interests of certain Member States whose reactions are more concentrated in specific sectors (see Annex 3.6, Table 6). Italy, Spain, Austria and Poland are among the most active Member States. Analysis of the reactions per Member State and by sector shows that Austria, Spain and Italy take a particular interest in the agriculture, fishery and foodstuffs sector. Most of the reactions issued by the Commission concern the construction and agricultural sectors.\nThanks to the access to all notifications and to the messages exchanged within the dialogues, Member States can use the Single Market Transparency Directive to draw on the ideas of their partners. These can be used to solve common problems regarding technical regulations and to understand when a draft technical regulation could be in breach of EU law."}

If the Commission, after reviewing the reasons brought forward by the Member State concerned, accepts the urgency procedure, the standstill period of 3 months does not apply and the measure can be adopted immediately. It typically takes the Commission several working days after the notification to decide whether it accepts the reasons brought forward by the Member State concerned and allows it to adopt the technical regulations immediately.\nOut of a total of 3 553 notifications, Member States made 346 requests to apply the urgency procedure to notified drafts (51 in 2016, 34 in 2017, 35 in 2018, 39 in 2019 and 187 in 2020). The use of the urgency procedure was refused for cases in which the justification was not sufficiently established or was based on purely economic grounds or national administrative delays, as well as in cases for which no unforeseeable circumstances were demonstrated. The urgency procedure was deemed justified in 283 cases (41 in 2016, 28 in 2017, 21 in 2018, 29 in 2019 and 164 in 2020). These cases concerned in particular psychotropic substances, control of narcotics, the fight against terrorism, firearms, infection of bees, biocidal products, prohibition of products that are harmful to health, pyrotechnic articles, medicines (critical medicines/substances necessary for the treatment of COVID-19 patients), protective equipment, masks, medical devices and in vitro medical devices, disinfectants and alcohols needed for their production (see Annex 3.7)."}

Reasons for these withdrawals include: (i) the notifying Member State’s introduction of substantial changes to the draft technical regulation, which required a new notification (Article 5(1) of the Directive); and (ii) the national authorities’ simple decision not to go ahead with adopting the draft technical regulation. For other notified draft technical regulations the dialogue is still ongoing."}

These meetings aimed to target specific single market needs of each Member State by means of a direct dialogue between the Commission and the national authorities, as well as through meetings with national stakeholders. In this context, the Commission visited several EU capitals and attended meetings with Member State authorities and national stakeholders. The main problems concerning implementation of the Single Market Transparency Directive at national level as identified through these missions concern the low level of notifications (e.g. in Romania, Lithuania and Portugal), administrative capacity (e.g. in Bulgaria) or coordination issues (e.g. in Italy, Spain and Germany) and limited knowledge of the Single Market Transparency Directive by national administrations.\nThroughout the reference period, the Commission also discussed the application of the Directive in the compliance dialogue meetings with Member States, which are carrried out following the commitment on the single market strategy. The Commission also regularly gave ad hoc technical seminars to the national authorities involved in the notification procedure.\nTurkey improved its participation in the notification procedure over the reference period."}

{"chunk_id": 178, "doc_title": "Report on the Operation of Single Market Transparency", "heading_2": "Transparency", "heading_3": "2.7.2 Participation of stakeholders", "heading_4": "na", "chunk": "2.7.2 Participation of stakeholders\nTransparency is a fundamental feature of the notification procedure. The TRIS website, which is publicly available, ensures that stakeholders are constantly informed about all draft technical regulations under preparation by Member States and that a dialogue between stakeholders and the Commission takes place, thanks to the function enabling stakeholders to submit contributions on draft technical regulations. As already mentioned, between 2016 and 2020, the Commission received 1 618 contributions via this functionality. Over the reference period, the Commission also started translating the final texts of the notified measures into all EU languages. The translations of the final texts are available on the TRIS website and provide additional transparency.\nThe success of the TRIS website is confirmed by numbers:\nAt the end of 2020 there were 6 467 active subscribers to the TRIS mailing list, compared to 5 196 at the end of 2015, marking a 25% increase over the 5-year reporting period.\nIn the period considered, 871 744 searches were carried out through the TRIS website (151 202 in 2016, 134 737 in 2017, 152 158 in 2018, 197 341 in 2019 and 236 306 in 2020), with an average of 174 349 searches per year.\nAccess to notifications by users also increased, from 1 203 299 occurrencies by the end of 2015 to 7 394 991 by the end of 2020, amounting to a specific increase of 514.6% over the whole reference period 2016-2020 compared with the end of 2015.\n3.\tConclusion\nDuring the period 2016-2020, the effectiveness of the Single Market Transparency Directive procedure was confirmed again in terms of transparency, administrative cooperation and prevention of technical barriers in the single market. The notification procedure’s preventive and networking approach reduced the risk that national regulatory activities could create technical barriers to the free movement of goods and information society services. In that respect, boosting the Member States’ participation in the Single Market Transparency Directive procedure, both in terms of notifications sent and of reactions to drafts notified by other Member States, demonstrates the joint ownership of the single market, which is a key objective for the Commission. In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Single Market Transparency Directive procedure ensured that that the primary objective of protecting health and human life was pursued by national  measures in compliance with the single market rules. The Directive and its notification system supported Member States in this respect by ensuring transparency, synergies and, ultimately, European solidarity.\nThe Directive’s importance is proven by stakeholders’ growing interest in the notification procedure and the number of contributions by them via the TRIS website in the reference period. This growing interest mirrors the effort to improve the transparency and the efficiency of the TRIS website.\nThe notification procedure has also confirmed its usefulness in providing the possibility to identify areas where further harmonisation at EU level is necessary, such as harmonisation of packaging labelling for disposal of waste. Efforts will continue to ensure a clear legal framework for economic operators, aiming to enhance the competitiveness of European enterprises in the EU and abroad, while taking into account the links between the notification procedure and the procedure established by the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade in the context of the World Trade Organization (WTO).\nThe experience gained in these recent years is essential to build up this improved landscape for the implementation of the Single Market Transparency Directive. To achieve the Directive’s full potential, the Commission will continue to incentivise Member States’ participation, both in notifying national draft technical regulations and in reacting to drafts notified by other Member States. In its reactions, the Commission will put special emphasis on matters of significant importance to the single market and on those that serve in particular to efficiently address bottlenecks identified in the context of the recovery and green and digital transitions. This greater focus will also lead to the appropriate follow-up to the Commission reactions so that effective action is taken to prevent potential barriers from being put in place."}
