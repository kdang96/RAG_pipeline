application\n(1) This State Treaty applies to the event and the offer, distribution and accessibility of broadcasting and telemedia in Germany.\n(2) Insofar as this State Treaty does not contain any other regulations for the organisation and distribution of broadcasting or permits such regulations, the state law provisions applicable to the respective broadcaster or the respective private broadcaster are to be applied.\n(3) This State Treaty and the state law provisions apply to television broadcasters if they are established in the Federal Republic of Germany.\nA television broadcaster is considered to be established in the Federal Republic of Germany if\n1. The head office is located in Germany and the editorial decisions concerning the audiovisual media service are taken there,\n2. The head office is located in Germany and the editorial decisions concerning the audiovisual media service are taken in a different Member State of the European Union, but\na) a substantial part of the personnel entrusted with the implementation of program-related activities is active in Germany or\nb) a substantial part of the personnel entrusted with the provision of the audiovisual media service is employed both in Germany and in the other Member State of the European Union, or\nc) a substantial part of the personnel entrusted with program-related activities does not work in Germany or the other Member State of the European Union, but the television broadcaster in Germany first started its activity and a permanent and actual connection with the German economy persists, or\n3. The head office is situated in Germany and the editorial decisions concerning the audiovisual media service are taken in a non-EU state, or vice versa, but a substantial part of the personnel entrusted with the provision of the audiovisual media service is employed in Germany.\n(4) For television broadcasters, insofar as they are not already subject to legal sovereignty in Germany or another Member State of the European Union, this State Treaty and the provisions of state law also apply in the event of the following:\n1. If they use a satellite ground station located in Germany for the uplink or\n2. Although they do not use a satellite ground station in a Member State of the European Union for the uplink, they do use transmission capacity from a satellite allocated to Federal Republic of Germany.\nIf neither of these two criteria are met, this State Treaty and the state law provisions also apply to television broadcasters if they broadcast in Germany in accordance with §§ 49 to 55 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, OJ C 115, 9 May 2008 p. 47.\n(5) This State Treaty and the state law provisions do not apply to programmes of television broadcasters that\n1. Are intended exclusively for reception in third countries and\n2. Are not broadcasted directly or indirectly to the general public on commercially available consumer devices in a country within the scope of Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (OJ L 95, 15 April 2010, p. 1).\n(6) The provisions of Section II and Section IV of this State Treaty only apply to teleshopping channels if this is expressly determined.\n(7) This State Treaty applies to providers of telemedia if they are established in the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with the provisions of the Telemedia Act.\n(8) Notwithstanding paragraph 7, this State Treaty applies to media intermediaries, media platforms and user interfaces insofar as they are intended for use in Germany. Media intermediaries, media platforms or user interfaces are to be regarded as intended for use in Germany if they are aimed at users in the Federal Republic of Germany, in particular through the language used, the content or marketing activities offered, or if they aim to refinance a substantial part of such in the Federal Republic of Germany. For the purposes of §§ 97 to 100, this State Treaty applies to video sharing services within the scope of Directive (EU) 2010/13/EU, as amended by Directive (EU) 2018/1808/EU, if they comply with the regulations of the Telemedia Act established in the Federal Republic of Germany; otherwise sentence 1 applies.\n(9) Television broadcasters are obliged to inform the body responsible under state law of any changes that could affect the establishment of sovereignty under paragraphs 3 and 4. State media authorities shall compile a list of private television broadcasters subject to legal sovereignty in Germany, keep them up to date and state on which of the criteria mentioned in paragraphs 3 and 4 the sovereignty is based. The list and all updates to this list will be sent to the European Commission together with the list of public service broadcasters.\n§ 2\nDefinitions\n(1) Broadcasting is a linear information and communication service; it is intended for the general public and for simultaneous reception and the dissemination of journalistic-editorially designed offers of moving images or sound along a transmission schedule by means of telecommunications. The term includes offers that are distributed in encrypted form or that can be received for a special fee. Telemedia are all electronic information and communication services unless they are telecommunications services as per § 3 subparagraph 24 of the Telecommunications Act which wholly involve the transmission of signals via telecommunications networks, or are telecommunications-supported services pursuant to § 3 subparagraph 25 of the Telecommunications Act or radio broadcasting as per sentences 1 and 2.\n(2) In accordance with this Act, this State Treaty applies to:\n1.

Advertising is, in particular, radio advertising, sponsoring, teleshopping and product placement; § 8 paragraph 9 and § 22(1) sentences 2 and 3 remain unaffected,\n8. Broadcast advertising is any statement in the exercise of a trade, business, craft or profession that is broadcast on the radio by a public or private broadcaster or an individual either for a fee or a similar consideration or as self-promotion, with the aim of promoting the sale of goods or the provision of services, including immovable property, rights and obligations, for a fee,\n9.

Media intermediary provider, who is responsible for the aggregation, selection and generally accessible presentation of content,\n22. Video sharing service means a telemedia service in which the main purpose of the service or a separable part of the service or an essential function of the service is to provide programmes to the general public with moving images or user-generated videos for which the service provider has no editorial responsibility, and where the service provider determines the organisation of the programmes or the user-generated videos, which can also mean by automatic means,\n23. Video sharing service provider, who operates a video sharing service,\n24. User-generated video of a sequence of moving images with or without sound created by a user, which is an individual component regardless of its length and which is uploaded to a video sharing service by this or another user,\n25.

Comments must be clearly separated from the reporting and marked as such with the author’s name.\n(2) When reproducing opinion polls carried out by broadcasters, it must be expressly stated whether they are representative.\n§ 7\nAccessibility\n(1) In addition to their existing commitment, the organisers according to § 3 sentence 1 should take up accessible offers within the scope of the technical and financial possibilities and continuously and gradually expand the scope of such offers.\n(2) The organisers of nationwide private television programmes report to the respective responsible state media agency, ARD regional broadcasters, ZDF and Deutschlandradio and their respective supervisory bodies at least every 3 years on the measures taken in accordance with paragraph 1. The reports will then be sent to the European Commission.\n§ 8\nAdvertising principles, labelling requirements\n(1) Advertising may not\n1. Violate human dignity,\n2. Advertising may not violate human dignity or include or promote discrimination based on gender, race or ethnic origin, nationality, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation,\n3. Mislead or harm the interests of consumers, or\n4. Promote behaviours that endanger health or safety, as well as the protection of the environment.\n(2) Radio advertising forms part of the programme. Radio advertising or advertisers may not influence the rest of the programme in terms of content or editorial content. Sentences 1 and 2 apply accordingly to teleshopping spots, teleshopping windows and their providers.\n(3) Advertising must be easily recognisable as such and distinguishable from the editorial content. No subliminal influencing techniques may be used in advertising. Even when new advertising technologies are used, radio advertising and teleshopping must be separated from the other parts of the programme appropriately by clear optical, acoustic, or spatial means.\n(4) Partial coverage of the broadcast image with radio advertising is permitted if the radio advertising is clearly optically separated from the rest of the programme and identified as such. This radio advertising is counted towards the duration of the spot advertising according to §§ 39 and 70. § 9(1) applies accordingly.\n(5) Continuous advertising programmes are permitted if the advertising aspect is clearly in the foreground and the advertising is an essential part of the broadcast. They must be announced as a continuous advertising programme at the beginning and marked as such throughout their entire duration. Sentences 1 and 2 also apply to teleshopping.\n(6) The insertion of virtual advertising in programmes is permitted if\n1. Such is announced at the beginning and at the end of the programme in question, and\n2. If it replaces any advertising that already exists at the place of transmission.\nOther rights shall remain unaffected. Line 1 also applies to teleshopping.\n(7) Surreptitious advertising and topic placement as well as corresponding practices are not permitted. Product placement is permitted, except in news programmes, programmes for political information, consumer programmes, regional window programmes in accordance with § 59(4), window programmes in accordance with § 65, programmes with religious content and children’s programmes. Programmes that contain product placement must meet the following requirements:\n1. The editorial responsibility and independence regarding content and placement in the broadcast schedule must remain unaffected,\n2. The product placement must not directly encourage the purchase, rental or lease of goods or services, in particular not by means of special sales-promoting references to these goods or services, and\n3. The product must not be emphasised too strongly; this also applies to low-value goods that are made available free of charge.\nProduct placement must be clearly indicated. It must be appropriately identified at the beginning and end of a programme and when it continues after an advertising break or on the radio by means of an equivalent notice. The labelling requirement does not apply to programmes that have not been produced or commissioned by the organiser itself or by a company affiliated with the organiser, and unless it can be determined with reasonable effort whether product placement is included; this should be pointed out. The state broadcasting corporations, ZDF and the state media authorities, which are part of ARD, establish uniform labelling.\n(8) In television advertising and teleshopping on television, no person may appear who regularly presents news programmes or programmes on current political affairs.\n(9) Political, ideological or religious advertising is not permitted. Sentence 1 applies, mutatis mutandis, to teleshopping. Free public service contributions, including calls for donations for charity purposes, are not considered advertising within the meaning of sentence 1. § 68 remains unaffected.\n(10) Advertising and teleshopping for alcoholic beverages must not promote excessive consumption of such beverages.\n(11) The non-nationwide distribution of radio advertising or other content in a nationwide programme or a commissioned or authorised nationwide distribution is only permitted if and to the extent permitted by the law of the country in which the non-nationwide distribution takes place. A non-nationwide broadcast advertising or other content from private broadcasters requires a separate state approval; this can be made dependent on the content requirements to be determined by law.\n(12) Nor do paragraphs 1-11 apply to teleshopping channels.\n§ 9\nInsertion of advertising and teleshopping\n(1) Broadcasts of services and programmes for children may not be interrupted by radio advertising or teleshopping.\n(2) Individually broadcast advertising and teleshopping spots on television must remain the exception; this does not apply to the transmission of sporting events. The insertion of advertising or teleshopping spots on television must not impair the connection between programmes, taking into account the natural interruptions in the programme and the duration and type of the programme, and must not violate the rights of rights holders.\n(3) Films with the exception of series and documentaries as well as feature films and news programmes may be interrupted once for television or teleshopping for each programmed period of at least 30 minutes.\n(4) If radio advertising or teleshopping in a television programme is specifically and frequently aimed at viewers from another country that has ratified the European Convention on Transfrontier Television and is not a member of the European Union, the regulations applicable to television advertising or teleshopping that apply there may not be circumvented. Sentence 1 does not apply if the provisions of this State Treaty on radio advertising or teleshopping are stricter than those applicable in the state concerned, nor if agreements in this area have been concluded with the state concerned.\n§ 10\nSponsoring\n(1) The existence of a sponsorship agreement must be clearly indicated; for programmes that are wholly or partially sponsored, funding by the sponsor must be clearly and reasonably indicated at the beginning or at the end; the reference is also possible in this context by moving images. In addition to or instead of the sponsor’s name, their company emblem or brand, another symbol of the sponsor, a reference to their products or services or a corresponding distinctive symbol can also be shown.\n(2) The content of a sponsored radio programme or a sponsored programme and programme location of a programme may not be influenced by the sponsor in such a way that the editorial responsibility and independence of the broadcaster are impaired.\n(3) Sponsored programmes may not encourage the sale, purchase or rent or lease of products or services of the sponsor or a third party, especially by means of corresponding special instructions.\n(4) News programmes and programmes for political information may not be sponsored. The display of sponsor logos is prohibited in children’s and religious programmes.\n(5) Paragraphs 1-4 also apply to teleshopping channels.\n(6) § 8(3) sentence 3 and (8-10) shall apply accordingly.\n§ 11\nCompetitions\n(1) Game shows and competitions are permitted. They are subject to transparency and participant protection. They must not mislead nor harm the interests of the participants. In particular, the programme must be informed about the costs of participation, the eligibility to participate, the game design and the resolution of the task. The interests of the protection of minors are to be protected. Only a fee of up to EUR 0.50 may be charged for participation; § 35 sentence 3 remains unaffected.\n(2) Upon request, the organiser must provide the supervisory authority with all documents and provide the information that is necessary to check that the broadcasts and competitions have been carried out correctly.\n(3) Paragraphs 1-2 also apply to teleshopping channels.\n§ 12\nData processing for journalistic purposes, media privilege\n(1) Insofar as the state broadcasters affiliated to ARD, ZDF, Deutschlandradio or private broadcasters process personal data for journalistic purposes, the persons concerned are prohibited from processing this personal data for other purposes (data secrecy). These persons are obliged to maintain data secrecy when they start their work. This obligation also applies after the termination of their activities. With regard to data processing for journalistic purposes, Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (OJ L 119 of 4.5.2016, p. 1; L 314 of 22.11.2016, p. 72) except for Chapters I, VIII, X and XI only § 5 paragraph 1 letter f in conjunction with paragraph 2, § 24 and § 32. §§ 82 and 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 apply with the proviso that liability only applies to a breach of data secrecy in accordance with sentences 1 to 3 and for inadequate measures in accordance with § 5(1) (f), §§ 24 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Sentences 1 to 5 apply accordingly to the auxiliary and associated companies belonging to the positions mentioned in sentence 1. The state broadcasters affiliated to ARD, ZDF, Deutschlandradio and other broadcasters as well as their associations may write their own codes of conduct that are issued and published in a transparent procedure. The data subjects are only entitled to the rights specified in paragraphs 2 and 3.\n(2) If the journalistic processing of personal data leads to the dissemination of counter-notifications by the data subject or to declarations of commitment, resolutions or judgements on the omission of the dissemination or revocation of the content of the data, then these counter-notifications, declarations of commitment and revocations regarding the stored data are to be kept with such for the same period of time as the data itself and when transmitting the data together with it.\n(3) If a person’s reporting rights are impaired by reporting, the data subject can request information about the data on which the reporting is based and which is stored about them. The information can be refused after weighing up the protection-worthy interests of the parties involved.\n1. The data can be used to draw conclusions about persons who are involved in the preparation, production or distribution of broadcasts,\n2. Conclusions can be drawn from the data regarding the person of the sender or the guarantor of articles, documents and communications regarding the editorial aspect or\n3. By communicating the researched or otherwise obtained data, the journalistic task would be impaired by researching the information stock.\nThe data subject can request the immediate correction of incorrect personal data in the data record or the addition of an appropriate representation of a reasonable extent. The further storage of personal data is lawful if this is necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information or for the protection of legitimate interests.\n(4) The supervision of compliance with the applicable data protection regulations is determined by state law for the regional broadcasting corporations, ZDF, the German radio and private broadcasters, as well as associated companies and auxiliary companies belonging to ARD. The provisions of the Interstate Broadcasting Treaty remain unaffected.\n(5) Paragraphs 1-4 also apply to teleshopping channels.\n§ 13\nBroadcasting of major events\n(1) Television broadcasting of events of significant social importance (major events) in the Federal Republic of Germany is encrypted and for a special fee only permitted if the television broadcaster or a third party enables the event, at least in a freely receivable and generally accessible television programmes in the Federal Republic of Germany to be broadcast simultaneously or, if this is not possible due to parallel events, whereby it may be broadcast with a slight delay. If there is no agreement on the appropriateness of the conditions, the parties should agree on arbitration in accordance with §§ 1025 et seqq. of the Code of Civil Procedure in good time before the event; if the agreement of an arbitration procedure does not occur for reasons for which the television broadcaster or the third party is responsible, the broadcast according to sentence 1 is not considered to be possible under reasonable conditions. Only a programme that is actually available in more than two thirds of households is considered to be a generally accessible television programme.\n(2) For the purposes of this Ordinance, the following are defined as major events:\n1. Olympic summer and winter games,\n2. European and World Championships in football, all games with German participation as well as the opening game, the semi-finals and the final, regardless of German participation,\n3. The semi-finals and the final for the Club Cup of the German Football Association,\n4. Home and away games of the German national football team,\n5. Finals of the European Club Championships in football (Champions League, Europa League) with German participation.\nIn the case of major events that consist of several individual events, each individual event counts as a major event. The inclusion or removal of events in this provision is only permitted by a State Treaty in all countries.\n(3) If a Member State of the European Union shares its provisions on the broadcasting of major events in accordance with § 3a of Council Directive 89/552/EEC on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the pursuit of television broadcasting activities, as amended by Directive 97/36/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Commission and if the Commission does not raise any objections within 3 months of the notification and if the provisions of the Member State concerned are published in the Official Journal of the European Union, the broadcast of major events is encrypted and for a fee for that Member State is only permitted if the broadcaster enables broadcasting in a freely accessible programme in accordance with the provisions of the Member State concerned published in the Official Journal.\n(4) If provisions of a state which has ratified the European Convention on Transfrontier Television as amended in the amending protocol of 9 September 1998 have been published in accordance with the procedure referred to in § 9a paragraph 3 of the Convention, this regulation applies to broadcasters in the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with sentence 4, unless the Prime Ministers of the federal states refuse to recognise the regulation within a period of 6 months via a unanimous decision. Recognition can only be refused if the provisions of the state concerned violate the Basic Law or the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The regulations applicable to organisers in the Federal Republic of Germany in accordance with the aforementioned procedure must be published in the official publications of the federal states. On the day of the last announcement in the state publications, the broadcast of major events is encrypted and only permitted for a fee for this state if the television broadcaster permits broadcasting there in a freely accessible programme in accordance with the published regulations of the state concerned.\n(5) If an organiser violates the provisions of paragraphs 3 and 4, the approval can be revoked. Instead of a revocation, the approval can be provided with additional provisions, insofar as this is sufficient to remedy the violation.\n§ 14\nShort reporting\n(1) Every television broadcaster authorised in Europe has the right to free short reports on events and events that are publicly accessible and of general information interest for their own broadcasting purposes. This right includes the power of access, short-term direct transmission, recording, their evaluation for a single contribution and the disclosure under the conditions of paragraphs 2 to 12.\n(2) Other statutory provisions, in particular those of copyright and personal protection, remain unaffected.\n(3) Paragraph 1 does not apply to the churches and other religious communities and their institutions with the corresponding tasks.\n(4) The free short report is limited to a short news report corresponding to the occasion. The permissible duration is based on the length of time it takes to convey the informational content of the event. In the case of short-term and regularly recurring events of a similar nature, the maximum duration is usually one and a half minutes. If brief reports on events of a comparable type are summarised, the summary character must also be preserved in this summary.\n(5) The right to short reporting must be exercised in such a way that there are no avoidable disruptions to the event. The organiser can restrict or exclude the transmission or recording if it can be assumed that otherwise the execution of the event would be questioned or the moral sense of the event participants would be grossly violated. The right to short reporting is excluded if there are reasons for public security and order and these outweigh the public interest in information. The organiser’s right to exclude the transmission or recording of the event as a whole remains unaffected.\n(6) For the exercise of the right to short reporting, the organiser can demand the generally provided entrance fee; otherwise, they must be reimbursed for the necessary expenses incurred through the exercise of the right.\n(7) For the exercise of the right to short reporting on professional events, the organiser can demand a low fee corresponding to the nature of the short reporting. If no agreement is reached on the amount of the remuneration, arbitration proceedings should be agreed in accordance with §§ 1025 et seqq. of the Code of Civil Procedure. The absence of an agreement on the amount of the remuneration or on the conduct of arbitration does not prevent the exercise of the right to short reporting; the same applies to a pending legal dispute regarding the amount of the remuneration.\n(8) Exercising the right to short reporting requires the television broadcaster to register with the broadcaster at least 10 days before the start of the event. The latter must notify the registering television broadcasters at least 5 days before the start of the event whether there are sufficient spatial and technical possibilities for transmission or recording. For short-term events, registrations must be made as early as possible.\n(9) If the spatial and technical conditions are not sufficient for all registrations to be taken into account, the television broadcasters who have concluded contractual agreements with the broadcaster or the sponsor of the event have priority. In addition, the organiser or the sponsor of the event has the right to choose. First of all, those television broadcasters must be taken into account that ensure comprehensive coverage of the country in which the event takes place.\n(10) TV broadcasters who take care of the short reporting are obliged to make the signal and the recording available immediately to those broadcasters against reimbursement of the reasonable expenses that could not be approved.\n(11) If the broadcaster or the sponsor of an event enters into a contractual agreement with a television broadcaster for reporting, they must ensure that at least one other television broadcaster may receive a short report.\n(12) The parts not used for the short reporting must be destroyed no later than 3 months after the end of the event; the event organiser or carrier of the event must be informed of the destruction in writing. The deadline is interrupted by the exercise of the legitimate interests of third parties.\n§ 15\nEuropean productions, own, commissioned and joint productions\n(1) The broadcasters contribute to securing German and European film and television productions as cultural assets and as part of their audiovisual heritage.\n(2) In order to present the diversity in German-speaking and European countries and to promote European film and television productions, television broadcasters should reserve the majority of their total airtime for feature films, television games, series, documentaries and comparable productions in accordance with European law.\n(3) Full television programmes should contain a significant proportion of in-house productions as well as commissioned and joint productions from German-speaking and European countries. The same applies to television programmes, insofar as this is possible according to their main focus.\n(4) As part of its programme mandate and taking into account the principles of efficiency and economy, public service broadcasting is entitled to provide qualitative and quantitative assurance of its programme procurement to participate in film grants without having to pay anything in return. Other state regulations remain unaffected.\n§ 16\nObligation to provide information to competent authorities under the European Convention on Transfrontier Television\n(1) The broadcasters of state law are obliged to provide the authority responsible under state law in accordance with § 6(2) of the European Convention on Transfrontier Television with the information listed there on request. The same applies to private television broadcasters who, on request, have to provide the information of the state media authority of the country in which the licence was granted. The latter forwards the information to its legal supervisory authority.\n(2) The Prime Ministers of the federal states decide by decision one or more of the authorities mentioned in paragraph 1, which perform the tasks under § 19(2) and (3) of the European Convention on Transfrontier Television. These authorities are to be provided with all necessary information by the competent authorities of the individual countries in order to perform their tasks.\n(3) Paragraphs 1 and 2 apply accordingly insofar as there are legally binding reporting obligations of the federal states for broadcasting to intergovernmental institutions or international organisations. Line 1 shall not apply to teleshopping channels.\n2. Subsection\nTelemedia\n§ 17\nGeneral principles, freedom of approval and registration\nAccording to the law, telemedia do not need to be granted approval nor registration. The constitutional order applies to the offers. The provisions of the general laws and the legal regulations for the protection of personal honour are to be observed.\n§ 18\nInformation obligations and information rights\n(1) Telemedia providers who do not serve exclusively personal or family purposes must ensure the following information is easily recognisable, immediately accessible and constantly available:\n1. Names and addresses, in addition to\n2. In the case of legal entities, the name and address of the authorised representative.\n(2) Telemedia providers with journalistic and editorially designed offers, in which in particular complete or partial content of periodical print products are reproduced in text or image, have a person responsible in addition to the information in accordance with §§ 5 and 6 of the Telemedia Act, stating the name and the address of such. If several responsible persons are named, it must be indicated for which part of the service the respective named person is responsible. Only those who are responsible can be named\n1. Is permanently resident in Germany,\n2. Has not lost the legal ability to exercise an official function as a result of a criminal conviction,\n3. Is fully competent and\n4. Can be prosecuted without restriction.\nSentence 3 subparagraphs 3 and 4 does not apply to young people who are responsible for telemedia intended for young people.\n(3) Telemedia providers in social networks are obliged to indicate the fact of automation in the case of automatically generated content or messages by means of a computer programme, provided that the external user account has been made available for use by individuals. The shared content or the message must be preceded by a clearly legible notice that this was created and sent automatically using a computer programme that controls the user account. A creation in the sense of this regulation does not only exist if content and messages are automatically generated immediately before transmission, but also if a pre-prepared content or a pre-programmed message is automatically used when sending.\n(4) For providers of telemedia according to paragraph 2 sentence 1, § 5 applies accordingly.\n§ 19\nDue diligence obligations\n(1) Telemedia with journalistic-editorially designed offers, in which in particular complete or partial content of periodical print products is reproduced in text or image, must comply with the recognised journalistic principles. The same applies to other commercially offered, journalistic and editorially designed telemedia, which regularly contain news or political information and which do not fall under sentence 1. Messages are to be checked by the provider for content, origin and truth before being distributed with due diligence.\n(2) When reproducing opinion polls carried out by broadcasters, telemedia providers must expressly state whether they are representative.\n(3) Providers according to paragraph 1, sentence 2, who are not subject to self-regulation by the press code and the complaints code of the German Press Council, can join a voluntary self-regulation institution recognised according to paragraphs 4 to 8. Recognised voluntary self-regulation institutions check compliance with the obligations under paragraphs 1 and 2 of the providers connected to them. Pursuant to paragraph 4 subparagraph 4, they are required, under their rules of procedure, to immediately investigate complaints regarding their affiliated providers.\n(4) An institution is to be recognised as an institution of voluntary self-regulation within the meaning of paragraph 3 if\n1. The independence and expertise of their designated examiners is guaranteed, taking into account representatives from social groups who deal with journalism issues in a special way,\n2. Proper equipment is ensured,\n3. There are requirements for the decisions of the examiners that are suitable in the practice of awarding to ensure compliance with the requirements of paragraphs 1 and 2,\n4. There are rules of procedure that regulate the scope and procedure of the examination as well as possible sanctions and provide for the possibility of reviewing decisions,\n5. It is ensured that the providers concerned are heard before a decision is made, the decision is justified in writing and communicated to the parties involved,\n6. A complaints office has been set up and\n7. The facility can be accessed by other providers.\n(5) The decision on recognition is made by the responsible state media authority.\n(6) The recognition can be revoked in whole or in part or provided with additional provisions if the prerequisites for the recognition have ceased to apply or the practice of the institution does not comply with the provisions of this State Treaty. No compensation shall be awarded for pecuniary losses as a result of the withdrawal of recognition.\n(7) The recognised institutions of voluntary self-regulation should coordinate the application of paragraphs 1 and 2.\n8) The responsible state media authority can object to decisions by a recognised voluntary self-regulatory body that exceed the limits of the assessment margin and request that they be annulled. If a recognised institution of voluntary self-regulation does not fulfil its tasks and duties, the responsible state media authority can request that they fulfil them. No compensation shall be awarded for any resultant pecuniary losses.\n§ 20\nCounter notification\n(1) Telemedia providers with journalistic-editorially designed offers, in which in particular complete or partial content of periodical print products are reproduced in text or image, are obliged to immediately reply to the person or body affected by a factual claim made in their offer without including costs for the person concerned in their offer without an additional access fee. The counter notification is to be offered in the same guise as the factual assertion, without involvement and omission. The counter notification must be offered as long as the factual claim is directly linked to it. If the factual claim is no longer offered or if the offer ends before the counter notification is received, the counter notification must be offered at a comparable point for as long as the factual claim was originally offered. A reply to the counter notification must be limited to factual information and must not be linked directly to the counter notification.\n(2) There is no obligation to start the counter notification pursuant to paragraph 1 if\n1. The person concerned has no legitimate interest in the counter notification,\n2. The scope of the counter notification goes unreasonably beyond that of the contested factual claim,\n3. The counter notification is not limited to factual information or has criminal content, or\n4. The counter notification is not received immediately, at the latest 6 weeks after the last day of the offer of the contested text, however in any case 3 months after the first posting of the offer, to the provider used in writing and signed by the person concerned or their legal representative.\n(3) Ordinary legal recourse is given for the enforcement of the counter notification claim made in vain. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure regarding the procedure for issuing an injunction are to be applied accordingly to this procedure. A threat to the claim need not be made credible. The main proceedings do not take place.\n§ 21\nAccessibility\nTelemedia providers should support barrier-free access to television programmes and telemedia comparable to television within the scope of their technical and financial possibilities.\n§ 22\nAdvertising, sponsorship, competitions\n(1) Advertising must be clearly recognisable as such and must be clearly separated from the other content of the offers. No subliminal techniques may be used in advertising. In the case of political, ideological or religious advertisements, the advertiser or client must be clearly indicated in an appropriate manner; § 10(1) sentence 2 applies accordingly.\n(2) For sponsorship of television text, § 10 applies accordingly.\n(3) For telemedia competitions according to paragraph 19 sentence 1, § 11 applies accordingly.\n§ 23\nData processing for journalistic purposes, media privilege\n(1) Insofar as the state broadcasters affiliated to the ARD, ZDF, Deutschlandradio, private broadcasters or companies and auxiliary companies to the press as providers of telemedia process personal data for journalistic purposes, the persons concerned are prohibited from processing this personal data for other purposes (data secrecy). These persons are obliged to maintain data secrecy when they start their work. This obligation also applies after the termination of their activities. Apart from Chapters I, VIII, X and XI of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, only § 5(1)(f) in conjunction with paragraph 2, § 24 and § 32 of the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 applies. §§ 82 and 83 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 apply with the proviso that liability only applies to a breach of data secrecy in accordance with sentences 1 to 3 and for inadequate measures in accordance with § 5(1) (f), §§ 24 and 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. Chapter VIII of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 does not apply insofar as companies, aid and associated companies in the press are subject to self-regulation through the press code and the complaints code of the German Press Council. Sentences 1 to 6 apply accordingly to the auxiliary and associated companies belonging to the positions mentioned in sentence 1. The data subjects are only entitled to the rights specified in paragraphs 2 and 3.\n(2) If personal data are stored, changed, transmitted, blocked or deleted by a provider of telemedia for journalistic purposes and if the data subject’s personal data are impaired by this, they can request information about the underlying data stored about them. The information can be refused after weighing up the protection-worthy interests of the parties involved.\n1. The data can be used to draw conclusions about persons who are involved in the preparation, production or distribution,\n2. Conclusions can be drawn from the data regarding the person of the sender or the guarantor of articles, documents and communications regarding the editorial aspect or\n3. By communicating the researched or otherwise obtained data, the journalistic task of the provider would be impaired by researching the information stock.\nThe data subject can request the immediate correction of incorrect personal data in the data record or the addition of an appropriate representation of a reasonable extent. The further storage of personal data is lawful if this is necessary for the exercise of the right to freedom of expression and information or for the protection of legitimate interests. Sentences 1 to 3 do not apply to offers from companies, aid and associated companies to the press, insofar as these are subject to self-regulation by the press code and the complaints regulations of the German Press Council.\n(3) If the journalistic processing of personal data leads to the dissemination of counter-notifications by the data subject or to declarations of commitment, resolutions or judgements on the omission of the dissemination or revocation of the content of the data, then these counter-notifications, declarations of commitment and revocations regarding the stored data are to be kept with such for the same period of time as the data itself and when transmitting the data together with it.\n§ 24\nTelemedia Act, public bodies\n(1) For telemedia that are subject to the provisions of this State Treaty or the provisions of the other broadcasting state treaties of the federal states, the provisions of the Telemedia Act as amended apply. Paragraph 2 remains unaffected.\n(2) In addition to the above provisions, the provisions of the Telemedia Act in its currently applicable version apply accordingly to the public bodies of the federal states.\n(3) Supervision of compliance with the provisions of the Telemedia Act is governed by state law.\n§ 25\nNotification\nAmendments to this section are subject to the notification requirement in accordance with Directive 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015, laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical standards and of rules on Information Society services.\nIII. Section\nSpecial provisions for public service broadcasting\n§ 26\nTask\n(1) The mission of the public service broadcasters is to act as a medium and factor in the process of free individual and public opinion formation by producing and disseminating their offers and thereby meeting the democratic, social and cultural needs of society. In their offers, the public service broadcasters have to provide a comprehensive overview of international, European, national and regional events in all major areas of life. In this way, they should promote international understanding, European integration and social cohesion in the federal and state governments. Their offers are used for education, information, advice and entertainment. They have to offer contributions in particular to culture. Entertainment should also correspond to a public service profile.\n(2) When fulfilling their mandate, public service broadcasters must take into account the principles of objectivity and impartiality of reporting, the diversity of opinions and the balance of their offers.\n(3) The public service broadcasters work together to fulfil their mandate; they regulate the cooperation in public law contracts.\n(4) The public service broadcasters are also of service of general economic interest within the meaning of § 106(2) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (OJ C 202, 7.6.2016, p. 47) entrusted to the extent that they work together to fulfil their mandate in accordance with paragraph 1 in the production and distribution of offers within the meaning of § 27. The entrustment applies in particular to the areas of production, production standards, acquisition of programme rights, programme exchange, dissemination and retransmission of offers, procurement, broadcasting network operation, information technology and other infrastructures, standardisation of business processes, contribution service and general administration. The entrustment does not include commercial activities in accordance with § 40 paragraph 1 sentence 2.\n§ 27\nOffers\n(1) Offers of public service broadcasting are broadcast programmes (radio and television programmes) and telemedia offers in accordance with this State Treaty and the respective state law regulations. Public service broadcasting can offer printed works with program-related content to accompany the programme.\n(2) Broadcast programmes that are broadcast simultaneously via different transmission channels are counted as an offer in numbers.\n§ 28\nTV programmes\n(1) The state broadcasters affiliated to ARD jointly organise the following television programmes:\n1. The full programme ‘Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen (Das Erste)’,\n2. Two programmes as additional offers in accordance with the concepts attached, namely the programmes\na) ‘tagesschau24’ and\nb) ‘EinsFestival’.\n(2) The following television programmes from one or more regional broadcasters affiliated to ARD are organised in accordance with their respective state laws:\n1.

Paragraphs 1 to 5 shall not apply. § 63 remains unaffected.\n(7) Without prejudice to any other notification obligations, the organiser and those directly or indirectly involved within the meaning of § 62 are obliged to give the responsible state media authority a declaration to the competent state media authority immediately after the end of a calendar year as to whether and to what extent within the past calendar year a change has occurred in the relevant participation and attribution criteria in accordance with § 62.\n§ 56\nRight to information and investigative powers\n(1) The responsible state media authority can carry out all investigations and collect all evidence that is necessary to fulfil its tasks arising from §§ 60 to 67, 122. It uses the evidence that it deems necessary to determine the facts at its reasonable discretion. In particular, it may:\n1. Obtain information,\n2. Listen to parties within the meaning of § 13 of the Administrative Procedures Act, hear witnesses and experts or obtain written statements from parties, experts and witnesses,\n3. Include documents and files,\n4. Inspect such.\nPeople other than those involved should only be consulted if the factual clarification does not lead to the goal or does not promise success.\n(2) There is an obligation for witnesses and experts to testify or to provide expert reports. The provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure regarding the obligation to testify as a witness or to provide an expert opinion, the refusal of experts and the questioning of members of the public service as witnesses or experts apply accordingly. Compensation for witnesses and experts is applied in accordance with the Judicial Remuneration and Compensation Act.\n(3) In order to demonstrate the completeness and correctness of the information, the responsible state media authority may require the submission of an affidavit from those who are obliged to provide information and submit a report in accordance with § 55(1) and 4. An affidavit should only be requested if other means of researching the truth are not available, have not led to a result or require disproportionate effort.\n(4) The persons entrusted by the responsible state media authority with the execution of the tasks arising from §§ 60 to 67 and § 122 may during normal business and working hours enter the business premises and property of § 55(1), (3) and (4) of the persons and partnerships mentioned and view and check the documents mentioned in paragraph 5 below. The basic right is thus restricted by § 13 of the Basic Law [Grundgesetz].\n(5) The persons or partnerships named in § 55(1), (3) and (4) have to provide records, books, business papers and other documents on request, which can be significant for the application of §§ 60 to 67 and § 122, must provide information and auxiliary services otherwise required to carry out the measures under paragraph 4. Precautions that hinder or complicate the measures are not permitted.\n(6) The obligated party may refuse to provide information in relation to those questions where a statement would expose them, or a relative named in § 383(1)(1) to (3) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, to the risk of prosecution under criminal law or a procedure under the Regulatory Offences Act.\n(7) Searches may only be carried out on the basis of an order from the magistrate in whose district the search is to take place. In the event of imminent danger, the persons referred to in paragraph 4 can carry out the necessary searches without a court order during business hours. An on the spot, record of the reason, time and place of the search and its essential result is to be noted down, from which, if no judicial order has been issued, the facts that lead to the assumption of a risk of default also result from such.\n(8) The owner of the rooms to be searched may attend the search. If they are absent, their representative or another witness should be present. Upon request, the owner of the searched rooms or their representative must be given a copy of the minutes mentioned in paragraph 7 sentence 3.\n§ 57\nObligation to publish and other submission obligations\n(1) Regardless of their legal form, each organiser must prepare and publish an annual financial statement including an appendix and a management report no later than the end of the 9th month following the end of the financial year, in accordance with the provisions of the Commercial Code that apply to large corporations. Sentence 1 applies accordingly to those directly involved in the organiser, to whom the organiser’s programme pursuant to § 62(1) sentence 1, and indirectly involved to whom the programme is to be attributed according to § 62(1) sentence 2.\n(2) Within the same period, the organiser must submit a list of the sources of the programme for the reporting period to the responsible state media agency.\n§ 58\nConfidentiality\nBeyond the scope of Directive (EU) 2016/679, information on the personal and factual circumstances of a natural person or legal entity or a partnership company as well as industrial or business secrets which become known to the competent authorities and bodies and civil servants thereof or to third parties commissioned and entrusted in the scope of fulfilling their tasks, or otherwise become known, may not be disclosed without authorisation.\n3. Subsection\nSecuring diversity of opinion\n§ 59\nDiversity of opinion, regional windows\n(1) In terms of content, the diversity of opinions is essentially to be expressed in private broadcasting. The significant political, ideological and social forces and groups must have their say in the full programmes; Minority views should be taken into account. The possibility of offering sector programmes is not affected by this.\n(2) A single programme must not have a major imbalance in the formation of public opinion.\n(3) As part of the approval process, the State Media Authority should work to ensure that interested parties with cultural programme contributions are also involved in the organisation of such. There is no legal entitlement to participation.\n(4) In the two nationwide most broadly broadcast full television programmes, at least in the temporally and regionally differentiated scope of the programme activities as of 1 July 2002, window programmes are to reflect the current and authentic representation of the events of political, economic, social and cultural life in the respective state. The main programme organiser has to ensure organisationally that the editorial independence of the window programme organiser is guaranteed. The window programme organiser is to be given a separate approval. Window programme organisers and main programme organisers should not be related to one another in an affiliated company in accordance with § 62, unless existing regional law regulations as of 31 December 2009 ensure independence in another way. Registrations existing as of 31 December 2009 remain unaffected. An extension is permitted. The financing by the main programme organiser must also be ensured via the organisation of the window programmes. The state media authorities coordinate the organisation of the window programmes in terms of time and technology, taking into account the interests of the organisers concerned.\n§ 60\nSecuring diversity of opinion on television\n(1) A company (natural or legal person or association of persons) may broadcast an unlimited number of programmes nationwide on television in the Federal Republic of Germany itself or through companies attributable to it, unless it gains dominant opinion in accordance with the following provisions.\n(2) If the programmes attributable to a company reaches an audience share of 30 per cent on average over a year, it is assumed that there is a predominant opinion. The same applies to a slight drop in the audience share, provided that the company has a dominant position in a media-related market or an overall assessment of its activities on television and in media-related markets shows that the influence of opinion thereby achieved is that of a company with an audience share corresponding to 30 per cent of a television audience share.\n(3) If a company has gained a predominant opinion with the programmes attributable to it, no approval may be granted for other programmes attributable to this company or the acquisition of further attributable participations in organisers must not be confirmed as harmless.\n(4) If a company has gained a predominant opinion with the programmes attributable to it, the responsible state media agency proposes to the company the following measures for determining the concentration in the media area (KEK, § 106 paragraph 2 sentence 1 subparagraph 3):\n1. The company can give them attributable participations in organisers until the attributable audience share of the company thereby falls below the limit according to paragraph 2 sentence 1, or\n2. In the case of paragraph 2 sentence 2, it can reduce its market position in media-related markets or give up attributable participations in organisers until there is no longer a predominant opinion under paragraph 2 sentence 2, or\n3. It can take measures to ensure diversity within the meaning of §§ 64 to 66 with the organisers attributable to it.\nThe KEK discusses the possible measures with the company with the aim of bringing about an amicable settlement. If no agreement can be reached or if the measures mutually agreed between the company and the KEK are not carried out within a reasonable period of time, the responsible state media agency, after the KEK has determined such, must revoke the approvals of so many programmes attributable to the company until a prevailing opinion the company is clearer. The KEK makes the selection taking into account the particularities of the individual case. No compensation shall be awarded for pecuniary losses as a result of the withdrawal of approval.\n(5) If an organiser with a full programme or a speciality programme with a focus on information reaches an audience share of 10 per cent on average within 1 year, they must allow airtime time for independent third parties within 6 months of the determination and notification by the responsible state media authority in accordance with § 65. If the organiser does not take the necessary measures, the responsible state media agency must revoke the approval after it has been determined by the KEK. Paragraph 4 sentence 5 applies accordingly.\n(6) The state media outlets jointly publish a report by the KEK every 3 years or at the request of the federal states on the development of concentration and on measures to ensure diversity of opinion in private broadcasting, taking into account\n1. Interconnections between television and media-related related markets,\n2. Horizontal links between broadcasters in different distribution areas and\n3. International media ties.\nThe report is also intended to comment on the application of §§ 60 to 66 and any necessary changes to these provisions.\n(7) The state media authorities publish a programme list to be drawn up by the KEK on an annual basis. All programmes, their organisers and their participants must be included in the programme list.\n§ 61\nDetermination of audience shares\n(1) The state media authorities use the KEK to determine the viewer share of the respective programmes, including all German-language programmes of public service broadcasting and private broadcasting available nationwide. What is decisive is the viewer share of the programmes to be included, which was achieved on average over the past 12 months when the procedure was initiated.\n(2) In accordance with a decision by the KEK, the state media authorities may commission a company to determine the audience shares; the contract is awarded based on the principles of efficiency and economy based on a tender. Based on representative surveys of viewers from the age of three, the determination must be carried out using generally recognised scientific methods. The state media authorities should agree with the company that the data collected on the basis of the determination of the audience share according to paragraph 1 sentence 1 can also be used contractually by third parties. In this case, the costs incurred by the state media authorities must be reduced accordingly.\n(3) The organisers are obliged to participate in determining the audience share. If an organiser does not meet their obligation to cooperate, the approval can be revoked.\n§ 62\nAttribution of programmes\n(1) All programmes are to be assigned to a company, which it organises itself or which are organised by another company in which it directly participates with 25% or more of the capital or voting rights. It also includes all programmes of companies in which it has an indirect stake, provided that these companies have a relationship with him as an affiliate within the meaning of § 15 of the German Stock Corporation Act and these companies have 25% or more of the capital or voting rights of an organiser involved. The companies affiliated within the meaning of sentences 1 and 2 are to be regarded as single companies and their shares in capital or voting rights are to be combined. If several companies cooperate on the basis of an agreement or in any other way in such a way that they can jointly exercise a controlling influence on a participating company, each of them is considered to be the dominant company.\n(2) A participation according to paragraph 1 is equivalent if a company alone or together with others can exert a comparable influence on an organiser. A comparable influence also applies if a company or a company that is already attributable to it for other reasons in accordance with paragraph 1 or paragraph 2 sentence 1\n1. Regularly organises a substantial part of the airtime of an organiser with programme parts supplied by it or\n2. On the basis of contractual agreements, statutory provisions or in any other way holds a position that makes essential decisions of an organiser regarding programme design, programme purchasing or programme production dependent on their consent.\n(3) Companies that have their registered office outside the scope of this State Treaty are also to be included in the attribution in accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2.\n(4) Existing family relationships must also be taken into account when examining and evaluating comparable influences on an organiser. The principles of commercial and tax law apply in this regard.\n§ 63\nChange in ownership structure\nAny planned change in ownership structure or other influences must be notified in writing to the responsible state media authority before it is implemented. The organiser and those directly or indirectly involved in the organiser within the meaning of § 62 are required to register. The changes may only be confirmed to be innocuous by the competent authority if it would be possible to issue a licence under the altered conditions. If a planned change is made that cannot be confirmed as harmless according to sentence 3, the approval must be revoked. § 110 applies to the revocation. For minor changes in shareholdings or other influences, the KEK can provide guidelines for exceptions to the notification requirement.\n§ 64\nDiversity measures\nIf the aforementioned regulations are based on measures to ensure diversity at an organiser or company, the following are considered to be such measures:\n1. The granting of airtime for independent third parties (§ 65),\n2. The establishment of a programme advisory board (§ 66).\n§ 65\nAirtime for independent third parties\n(1) A window programme which is broadcast on the basis of the obligation to grant airtime in accordance with the above provisions must, while preserving the programme autonomy of the main broadcaster, makes an additional contribution to the diversity of its programming, particularly in the areas of culture, education and information. The window programme must be designed independently of the main programme.\n(2) The duration of the window programme must be at least 260 minutes per week, of which at least 75 minutes must be during airtime from 7 p.m. to 11.30 p.m. Regional window programmes of up to a maximum of 150 minutes per week with a maximum of 80 minutes per week are counted towards the weekly airtime and the third airtime outside the broadcasting period specified in sentence 1; with a lower weekly broadcast time for the regional window, the creditable broadcast time is reduced accordingly by 80 minutes. Crediting is only permitted if the regional window programmes are organised with editorial independence and reach a total of at least 50 per cent of the television households in Germany. Falling below this range is permissible in the course of digitising the transmission paths.\n(3) The window programme provider according to paragraph 1 must not be legally dependent on the main programme organiser. Legal dependency within the meaning of sentence 1 exists if the main programme and the window programme can be attributed to the same company in accordance with § 62.\n(4) If a main programme broadcaster is obliged to grant airtime for independent third parties, the responsible state media agency, after having discussed with the main broadcaster, announces the window programme for granting approval. The responsible state media authority checks the incoming applications for their compatibility with the provisions of this State Treaty and the other state law provisions and notifies the main broadcaster of the applications that are eligible for approval. It discusses the proposals with the main programme organiser with the aim of making an amicable selection. If an agreement is not reached and the responsible state media agency has more than three admissible applications, the main broadcaster submits a tripartite proposal to the responsible state media agency. The responsible state media authority can add up to two further suggestions from a diversity perspective, which it then discusses again with the main broadcaster with the aim of making a mutually acceptable selection. If an agreement is not reached, it will select from the proposals the applicant whose programme is expected to make the greatest possible contribution to diversity in the programme of the main programme organiser and shall approve such. If there are three or fewer applications, the responsible state media authority makes the decision immediately.\n(5) If an applicant is selected for the window programme according to paragraph 4, the main programme organiser and the applicant conclude an agreement on the broadcasting of the window programme as part of the main programme. This agreement particularly includes the obligation of the main programme organiser to enable the window programme organiser to adequately finance its programme. The agreement must also stipulate that termination during the period of approval under paragraph 6 is only permissible due to serious breaches of contract or for an important reason with a period of 6 months.\n(6) On the basis of an agreement on reasonable conditions in accordance with paragraph 5, the window programme organiser is to be granted approval by the responsible state media authority to organise the window programme. In the approval of the main and the window programme organiser, the essential obligations from the agreement according to paragraph 5 are to be included as part of the approval. No compensation shall be awarded for pecuniary losses as a result of a partial withdrawal of approval from the main programme organiser. Approval for the window programme organiser is to be granted for a period of 5 years; it expires if the approval of the main broadcaster ends, is not extended or is not re-issued.\n§ 66\nProgramme advisory board\n(1) The programme advisory board has to advise those responsible for the program, the management of the programme organiser and the shareholders in the design of the programme. The programme advisory board should contribute suggestions and suggestions to ensure the diversity of opinion and plurality of the programme (§ 59). With the establishment of a programme advisory board by the organiser, its effective influence on the television programme must be guaranteed by contract or by-laws.\n(2) The members of the programme advisory board are appointed by the organiser. Because of their membership of social groups, they must provide a guarantee that the essential opinions are represented in society.\n(3) The programme advisory board is to be informed by the management about all questions concerning the programme. It can be heard by the responsible state media authority and in the event of programme complaints in the event of significant changes to the programme structure, the programme content, the programme schedule as well as programme-related hearings.\n(4) The programme advisory board may request information from the management to carry out its tasks and raise objections to the management regarding the programme or individual contributions. Management must comment on enquiries and complaints within a reasonable period. If, in the opinion of the programme advisory board, it does not adequately take into account the enquiries and complaints about the programme, it can request a decision of the supervisory body on the management, if none is available, one of the general meeting. A rejection of the submission of the programme advisory board by the general meeting or by the control body over the management requires a majority of 75 per cent of the votes cast.\n(5) In the event of changes to the programme structure, the programme content or the programme scheme or when deciding on programme complaints, the approval of the programme advisory board must be obtained before the management makes a decision. If this is refused or if a statement is not made within a reasonable period of time, management can only take the measure in question with the consent of the control body over the management, if none is available, the general meeting, for which a majority of 75% of the votes cast is required. The organiser must report the result of referral to the programme advisory board or the decision in accordance with sentence 2 to the responsible state media authority.\n(6) If the organiser with whom a programme advisory board is to be set up is a retail company, then paragraphs 4 and 5 apply, with the proviso that the programme advisory board, instead of the general meeting or the control body, manages the competent state media authority can call who decides on the measure.\n§ 67\nGuidelines\nThe state media authorities issue joint guidelines for the detailed design of §§ 59, 65 and 66. The guidelines for § 66 particularly stipulate the appointment and composition of the programme advisory board.\n§ 68\nAirtime for third parties\n(1) Upon request, the Evangelical Churches, the Catholic Church and the Jewish communities are to be given reasonable transmission times for the transmission of religious programmes; the organisers can request reimbursement of their own costs.\n(2) Parties must be given reasonable airtime during their participation in the elections to the German Bundestag against reimbursement of the costs involved if at least one state list has been approved for them. Furthermore, parties and other political associations are entitled to reasonable airtime for the European Parliament during their participation in the elections of representatives from the Federal Republic of Germany for reimbursement of the costs, if at least one election proposal has been approved for them.\n4. Subsection\nFinancing, advertising\n§ 69\nFinancing\nPrivate broadcasters can finance their radio programmes through revenues from advertising and teleshopping, through other revenues, in particular through fees paid by participants (subscriptions or individual fees), and from their own resources. Financing of private broadcasters from the broadcasting fee is not permitted. § 114 remains unaffected.\n§ 70\nDuration of television advertising\n(1) The proportion of airtime for television commercials and teleshopping spots may not exceed 20 per cent of this period in the periods from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., from 6 p.m. to 11 p.m. and from 11 p.m. to midnight. Sentence 1 shall not apply to product placement and sponsoring notices.\n(2) Notices by the broadcaster on own programmes and on accompanying materials that are derived directly from these programmes, or on programmes, radio programmes or telemedia comparable to broadcasting from other parts of the same broadcaster group, free contributions in the service of the public, including calls for donations for welfare purposes, statutory mandatory information and neutral single images between editorial content and television or teleshopping spots as well as between individual spots are not considered to be advertising.\n(3) Paragraphs 1 and 2 and § 9 do not apply to advertising channels.\n§ 71\nTeleshopping windows and self-promotion channels\n(1) Teleshopping windows broadcast in a programme that is not exclusively intended for teleshopping must have a minimum duration of 15 minutes without interruption. They must be visually and acoustically clearly marked as a teleshopping window.\n(2) Paragraphs 8 and 10 apply correspondingly to self-promotion channels. §§ 9 and 70 shall not apply to self-promotion channels.\n§ 72\nStatutes and directives\nThe state media authorities issue joint statutes or guidelines for the implementation of §§ 8 to 11, 70 and 71; The statute or guideline to § 11 particularly specifies the punishment for infringements and the conditions for the participation of minors. In doing so, they establish the behaviour with the regional broadcasting corporations affiliated to ARD and ZDF and conduct a mutual exchange of experience in the application of these guidelines.\n§ 73\nExceptions for regional and local television broadcasters\nRegulations deviating from § 8(4) sentence 2, § 9(3) and § 70(1) can be made for regional and local television programmes according to state law.\nSection V\nSpecial provisions for individual telemedia\n1. Subsection\nTelemedia comparable to broadcasting\n§ 74\nAdvertising, competitions\n§§ 8, 10 and 11 apply accordingly with regard to telemedia comparable to broadcasting. §§ 3 to 16 apply accordingly to offers in accordance with § 2(3) and other linearly distributed telemedia comparable to television.\n§ 75\nShort reporting\n§ 14 applies accordingly to telemedia comparable to television if the same programme is offered by the same television broadcaster with a time delay.\n§ 76\nAccessibility\n§ 7(1) and (2) apply to telemedia comparable to television.\n§ 77\nEuropean productions\nIn order to present the diversity in German-speaking and European countries and to promote European film and television productions, providers of telemedia comparable to television ensure that the proportion of European works in their catalogues corresponds to at least 30 per cent. Sentence 1 does not apply to providers of telemedia comparable to television with low sales or low number of viewers or if this is impracticable or unjustified due to the nature or subject of the telemedia comparable to television. Works according to sentence 1 are to be highlighted in the catalogues. The state media authorities regulate the details of the implementation of sentences 1 to 3 via a joint statute.\n2. Subsection\nMedia platforms and user interfaces\n§ 78\nScope of application\nThe following regulations apply to all media platforms and user interfaces. With the exception of §§ 79, 80, 86(1) and § 111, they do not apply to:\n1. Infrastructure-related media platforms with usually less than 10 000 connected residential units and their user interfaces or\n2. Non-infrastructure-related media platforms and user interfaces that do not have user interfaces from media platforms according to paragraph 1, with typically less than 20 000 actual daily users on a monthly average.\nIn the statutes and directives, state media authorities set out criteria for determining the threshold values in accordance with § 88, taking regional and local conditions into account.\n§ 79\nGeneral provisions\n(1) An infrastructure-bound media platform may only be operated if the requirements of § 53(1) and (2) sentence 1 are met. With regard to the remainder, a provider of a media platform or a provider of a user interface or an authorised representative designated by the user must fulfil the requirements of § 53(1) and (2), sentence 1.\n(2) Vendors who wish to offer a media platform or user interface must notify the responsible state media authority at least 1 month prior to commissioning. The notification must contain the following:\n1. Information according to paragraph 1 sentence 1 and\n2. Information on the technical and expected range of use.\nIn the event of significant changes, sentences 1 and 2 apply accordingly.\n(3) The constitutional order applies to the offers in media platforms and user interfaces. The provisions of the general laws and the legal regulations for the protection of personal honour are to be observed.\n(4) Providers of media platforms and user interfaces are responsible for their own offers. If the supervisory authorities dispose of offers or content of third parties that are distributed via the media platform or are contained in user interfaces, they are obliged to implement this disposition. If measures against the person responsible for offers or content according to sentence 2 are not feasible or not promising, measures to prevent access to offers or content can also be directed against the provider of the media platform or user interface, provided that prevention is technically possible and reasonable.\n§ 80\nSignal integrity, overlays and scaling\n(1) Without the consent of the respective broadcaster or provider of telemedia comparable to broadcasting, its broadcast programmes, including the HbbTV signal, telemedia comparable to broadcasting or parts thereof\na) Unchanged in content and technology,\nb) In the course of their image or acoustic reproduction, not completely or partially overlaid with advertising, content from radio programmes or telemedia comparable to broadcasting, including recommendations or references thereto, or their image scaled for this purpose or\nc) Not included in offer packages or marketed in any other way for a fee or free of charge or made publicly available.\n(2) Deviating from paragraph 1(a), technical changes that only serve the efficient use of capacity and the compliance with the agreed or, in the event that no agreement has been made, do not impair standard market quality standards, are permissible. In deviation from paragraph 1(b), overlays or scaling are permitted for the purpose of using services of individual communication or if they are initiated by the user in individual cases. With the exception of recommendations or references to the content of radio programmes or telemedia comparable to broadcasting, sentence 2 does not apply to overlaying or scaling for advertising purposes.\n(3) In the case of an overlay or scaling for the purpose of advertising, the restrictions applicable to the overlaid or scaled offer apply accordingly, except in the cases of paragraph 2 sentence 2.\n§ 81\nAllocation of media platforms\n(1) The following provisions apply to infrastructure-related media platforms.\n(2) The provider of a media platform\n1. With regard to the digital distribution of television programmes, the following must be ensured within a technical capacity of a maximum of a third of the total capacity available:\na) The necessary capacities are available for the nationwide statutory programmes financed by contributions and for the third-party programmes of public service broadcasting, including programme-related services; for the state windows distributed within the framework of the third programmes, this only applies within the states for which they are legally intended,\nb) The capacities for the private television programmes which include regional windows in accordance with § 59, including programme accompanying services, are available; the television programmes, including the regional windows required by law for the respective region, must be distributed,\nc) The capacities are available for the regional and local television programmes and open channels approved in the respective state; this only applies within the area for which they are intended; the special national regulations for open channels and comparable offers remain unaffected,\nd) The technical capacities according to letters a to c are technically equivalent to other digital capacities,\n2.

Within the additional technical capacities, the decision on occupancy is made in accordance with § 82(2) and the general laws.\nParagraph 2 sentence 2 applies accordingly.\n(4) The provider of a media platform is exempt from the requirements of paragraphs 1 to 3, insofar as\n1. The provider of the responsible state media authority proves that they or a third party can receive the corresponding offers directly and without additional effort using a similar transmission path and the same end device, or\n2. The requirement of diversity of opinion and variety of offers has already been taken into account in the context of the assignment or assignment decision according to §§ 102 or 103.\n(5) Programmes that can be attributed to the provider of a media platform in accordance with § 62 or that are exclusively marketed by them are not taken into account when fulfilling the requirements of paragraph 2 subparagraphs 1 and 2. The provider of a media platform must immediately notify the relevant state media authority of the use of radio programmes upon request. If the requirements of paragraphs 2 to 4 are not met, the broadcasting programmes to be broadcast are selected in accordance with this State Treaty and state law by the responsible state media authority. Prior to this, the provider of a media platform must be given a reasonable period to meet the legal requirements.\n(6) With regard to regional and local media platforms that only broadcast radio and television programmes terrestrially, the state law may provide different regulations.\n§ 82\nAccess to media platforms\n(1) Providers of media platforms have to ensure that the technology used enables a diverse range of offers.\n(2) In order to ensure the diversity of opinion and the variety of offers, broadcasting, telemedia comparable to broadcasting and telemedia may not be directly or indirectly unreasonably hindered in accordance with § 19(1) when accessing media platforms and must not be treated differently from similar offers without an objectively justified reason; this applies in particular to\n1. Access systems,\n2. Interfaces for application programmes,\n3. Other technical requirements for subparagraphs 1 and 2 also towards manufacturers of digital radio receivers,\n4. The design of access conditions, in particular fees and tariffs.\n(3) The use of an access authorisation system or an interface for application programmes and the fees for this must be reported immediately to the responsible state media authority. Sentence 1 applies, mutatis mutandis, to amendments.

This is not the case for a framework law with no legal effect for individuals.\n“29. A rule is classified as a technical regulation for the purposes of Directive 83/189 if it has legal effects of its own. If, under domestic law, the rule merely serves as a basis for enabling administrative regulations containing rules binding on interested parties to be adopted, so that by itself it has no legal effect for individuals, the rule does not constitute a technical regulation within the meaning of the directive (see the judgment in Case C-317/92 Commission v Germany [1994] ECR 1-2039, paragraph 26). It should be recalled here that, according to the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) of Directive 83/189, the Member States must communicate, at the same time as the draft technical regulation, the enabling instrument on the basis of which it was adopted, should knowledge of such text be necessary to assess the implications of the draft technical regulation.”\nJudgment of 20 March 1997, Bic Benelux, C-13/96, EU:C:1997:173, paragraphs 19 and 20\nThe reasons for the adoption of a national measure are irrelevant to the classification of that measure as a ‘technical regulation’. The aim of the Directive is, by preventive monitoring, to protect the free movement of goods, which is one of the foundations of the Community.\n“19. […] There is no basis in Directive 83/189 for an interpretation limiting its application to national measures capable of harmonization only on the basis of Article 100a of the Treaty. The aim of that Directive is, by preventive monitoring, to protect the free movement of goods, which is one of the foundations of the Community. Such monitoring is necessary since technical regulations covered by the Directive are capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, intra-Community trade in goods. Such hindrances may arise from the adoption of national technical regulations even if those regulations do not duplicate markings affixed in the Member State of origin and irrespective of the grounds on which they were adopted.\n20. Consequently, the fact that a national measure was adopted in order to protect the environment or that it does not implement a technical standard which may itself constitute a barrier to free movement does not mean that the measure in question cannot be a technical regulation within the meaning of Directive 83/189.”\nJudgment of 16 November 2000, Donkersteeg, C-37/99, EU:C:2000:636, paragraphs 30 to 34\nDetailed rules on vaccination of animals are a ‘technical specification’. However, it will only be a ‘technical regulation’ requiring notification if its observance is compulsory de jure or de facto. That is not the case where, in the event of infringement of the rule, no restrictions are imposed on the marketing or use of the products concerned.\n“30. […] in accordance with Article 1(1) of the directive, so far as agricultural products are concerned, a 'technical specification’ is one contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product or its production methods and procedures.\n31. A rule such as that contained in Article 2(1) of the VBZA is a technical specification within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the directive. As the Commission rightly maintains, since the precise and detailed rules concerning vaccination against Aujeszky's disease are linked to the production, in the strict sense, of the agricultural product concerned and must be complied with throughout the production cycle, that rule therefore defines a 'procedure’ in the production of that product.\n32. Nevertheless, in order to be classified as a technical rule within the meaning of the directive, the rule at issue in the main proceedings must, in accordance with Article 1(5) of the directive, contain technical specifications 'the observance of which is compulsory, de jure or de facto, in the case of marketing or use in a Member State or a major part thereof, except those laid down by local authorities.\n33. It must be pointed out, as the Netherlands Government has done, that the rule in Article 2(1) of the VBZA imposes no restrictions on either the marketing or the use of the products concerned if, in contravention of that rule, pigs have not been vaccinated against Aujeszky's disease.\n34. The answer to be given to the second question must therefore be that a provision such as that in issue in the main proceedings which requires every farmer to have the pigs on his holding vaccinated against Aujeszky's disease is not, for the purposes of the directive, a technical regulation which ought to have been notified to the Commission before being adopted.”\nJudgment of 3 December 2020, Star Taxi App, C-62/19, EU:C:2020:980, paragraphs 60 and 61\nFor a national measure to be classified as a ‘technical regulation’, it must be binding de jure or de facto, on the provision or use of the service concerned, in a Member State or a major part thereof.\n“60. […] it is apparent from the first subparagraph of Article 1(1)(f) of Directive 2015/1535 that a ‘technical regulation’ means ‘technical specifications and other requirements or rules on services, including the relevant administrative provisions, the observance of which is compulsory, de jure or de facto, in the case of marketing, provision of a service, establishment of a service operator or use in a Member State or a major part thereof, as well as laws, regulations or administrative provisions of Member States, except those provided for in Article 7, prohibiting the manufacture, importation, marketing or use of a product or prohibiting the provision or use of a service, or establishment as a service provider’.\n61. It follows that, in order for national legislation affecting an information society service to be classified as a ‘technical regulation’, it must not only be classified as a ‘rule on services’ as defined in Article 1(1)(e) of Directive 2015/1535, but must also be compulsory, de jure or de facto, in the case, inter alia, of the provision of the service in question or its use in a Member State or a major part of that State.”"}
{"doc_title": "Case-law on Directive (EU) 20151535", "chunk": "Technical Specifications\n“‘technical specification’ means a specification contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product such as levels of quality, performance, safety or dimensions, including the requirements applicable to the product as regards the name under which the product is sold, terminology, symbols, testing and test methods, packaging, marking or labelling and conformity assessment procedures.\nThe term ‘technical specification’ also covers production methods and processes used in respect of agricultural products, as referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 38(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), products intended for human and animal consumption, and medicinal products as defined in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council ( 1 ), as well as production methods and processes relating to other products, where these have an effect on their characteristics;”\n(Article 1(1)(c) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535)\nJudgment of 11 January 1996, Commission v Netherlands, C-273/94, EU:C:1996:4, paragraph 13\nA national rule introducing a derogation from an existing technical regulation for a specific product constitutes a ‘technical regulation’ if it imposes alternative ‘technical specifications’ with which any person wishing to benefit from the derogation must comply.\n“13. The application to a specific product such as margarine of a regulation derogating from another technical regulation already in existence concerning the same product constitutes a technical regulation within the meaning of Article 1(5) of the directive since it establishes technical specifications within the meaning of Article 1(1) the observance of which is compulsory, de jure or de facto, when that product is marketed or used. If margarine is not manufactured in accordance with the provisions of the Margarine Decree, it may only be manufactured using substitute products authorized by the disputed order. Not only is the use of those substitute products restricted by the conditions laid down in the disputed order, but those products are the only alternatives to the products which may be used under the Margarine Decree. The disputed order should therefore have been notified in accordance with the directive.”\nJudgment of 30 April 1996, CIA Security International SA, C-194/94, EU:C:1996:172, paragraph 30\nA rule must be classified as a ‘technical regulation’ if it requires the undertakings concerned to apply for prior approval of their equipment, even if the envisaged administrative rules have not been adopted.\n“30. […] a rule must be classified as a technical regulation within the meaning of Directive 83/189 if, as the Belgian Government submitted at the hearing, it requires the undertakings concerned to apply for prior approval of their equipment, even if the administrative rules envisaged have not been adopted.”\nJudgment of 16 September 1996, Commission v Italy, C-279/94, EU:C:1997:396, paragraph 34\nA provision setting limits on the concentration of respirable asbestos fibres in workplaces is not a ‘technical specification’ as it does not define the characteristics required of a product.\n“34. According to Article 1, point 5 of the Directive, however, a 'technical regulation' is to be understood as meaning 'technical specifications, including the relevant administrative provisions, the observance of which is compulsory, de jure or de facto, in the case of marketing or use in a Member State'. According to Article 1, point 1, of the Directive, a 'technical specification' is a specification contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product such as levels of quality, performance and safety. Article 3(1) of Law No 257/92 lays down limits for the concentration of inhalable asbestos fibres at workplaces. Since this provision does not define a characteristic required of a product, it does not in principle fall within the definition of a technical specification and consequently cannot be regarded as a technical regulation which has to be notified to the Commission pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) of the Directive. Although observance of the value limits for concentrations of inhalable asbestos fibres provided for by Article 3 of Law No 257/92 may have consequences as regards the characteristics of the product in question, as these are provided for by Article 1, point 1 of the Directive, the Commission has not demonstrated how this could be the case.”\nJudgment of 17 September 1996, Commission v Italy, C-289/94, EU:C:1996:330, paragraph 32\nA decree regulating the quality of water intended for the cultivation of molluscs constitutes a ‘technical regulation’ subject to notification because of its direct impact on the marketing of the products concerned.\n“32.  Although Decree No 256 does concern certain aspects of the quality of the waters intended for edible lamellibranch molluscs, it nevertheless establishes, as the Commission has rightly pointed out, a very close correlation between the quality of waters used for such cultivation and the marketing of lamellibranch molluscs for human consumption. Thus, only molluscs grown in waters complying with the technical specifications laid down by Decree No 256 may be marketed. Compliance with those specifications, which are binding, thus has a direct impact on the marketing of the molluscs, with the result that Decree No 256 must be regarded as a technical regulation subject to the notification requirement under Article 8 of Directive 83/189.”\nJudgment of 11 May 1999, Albers and others, C-425/97 to 427/97, EU:C:1999:243, paragraphs 16 and 17\nThe rules prohibiting the administration of certain medicinal products to cattle constitute ‘technical specifications’ as they define methods of production for agricultural products.\n“16. [...] rules which, like those in the present case, are intended to prevent the administration of sympathicomimetic substances to fattening cattle over 14 weeks old constitute technical specifications within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Directive 83/189.\n17. Such rules define the production methods and procedures for agricultural products as defined in Article 38(1) of the EC Treaty (now, after amendment, Article 32(1) EC) intended for human consumption.”\nJudgment of 22 January 2000, Canal Satélite Digital, C-390/99, EU:C:2002:34, paragraphs 45 to 47\nA national rule requiring prior registration and certification of equipment for the digital transmission and reception of satellite television signals before it is marketed constitutes a ‘technical regulation’ because it defines the characteristics of the products concerned.\n“45. […] the Court has already held that national provisions which merely lay down conditions governing the establishment of undertakings, such as provisions making the exercise of an activity subject to prior authorisation, do not constitute technical regulations within the meaning of Article 1, point 9, of Directive 83/189. Technical regulations within the meaning of that provision are specifications defining the characteristics of products and not specifications concerning economic operators (Case C-194/94 CIA Security [1996] ECR I-2201, paragraph 25; Case C-278/99 Van der Burg [2001] ECR I-2015, paragraph 20).\n46. However, a national provision must be classified as a technical regulation within the meaning of Article 1, point 9, Directive 83/189 if it requires the undertakings concerned to apply for prior approval of their equipment (CIA Security, paragraph 30).\n47. It follows that a national rule which requires operators of conditional-access services to enter the equipment, decoders or systems for the digital transmission and reception of television signals by satellite which they propose to market in a register and to obtain prior certification for those products before being able to market them constitutes a “technical regulation” within the meaning of Article 1, point 9, of Directive 83/189.”\nJudgment of 26 September 2000, Unilever Italia, C-443/98, EU:C:2000:496, paragraphs 25 and 26\nA provision on the labelling of the origin of olive oil is a ‘technical specification’ because it is a requirement governing the labelling of a product.\n“25. Suffice is to note, on that point, that, according to Article 1(1) thereof, Directive 83/189 treats as 'products’ both industrial and agricultural products and that, according to paragraph 2 of the same article, Directive 83/189 treats as a 'technical specification’ any specification contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product, including the requirements applicable to the product as regards labelling. National rules containing such specifications constitute technical specifications within the meaning of Directive 83/189 irrespective of the grounds on which they were adopted (see, to that effect, Case C-13/96 Bic Benelux v Belgian State [1997] ECR I-1753, paragraph 19).\n26. Thus, the contested Law, which governs labelling indicating the origin of olive oil, contains rules which must be classified as 'technical specifications’ within the meaning of Directive 83/189.”\nJudgment of 12 October 2000, Snellers, C-314/98, EU:C:2000:557, paragraphs 37 to 39\nA 'technical specification' must relate to the product as such. A regulation that lays down the criteria for determining the date on which a vehicle is deemed to have been first authorised to operate on public roads, for the purposes of issuing a registration certificate, does not define any characteristic required of the product itself and therefore cannot be classified as a 'technical regulation'.\n“37. […] rules which, like those at issue in the main proceedings, are designed to determine the date on which a vehicle is first authorised for use on the public highway are not technical specifications for the purposes of Directive 83/189 and cannot therefore be classified as technical regulations falling within the scope of that directive.\n38. Article 1(1) of Directive 83/189 provides that, as regards products such as those at issue in the main proceedings, a technical specification for the purposes of that directive is 'a specification contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product. Technical specifications for the purposes of Directive 83/189 must thus refer to the product as such; that is, moreover, confirmed by the non-exhaustive list of the specifications concerned provided by way of example in Article 1(1) of that directive.\n39. The regulation lays down a number of criteria for establishing the date on which a vehicle, for the purposes of the Wegenverkeerswet, is deemed to have been first authorised to use the public highway, for the purposes of drawing up a registration certificate. The regulation does not therefore define any characteristic required of the product as such.”\nJudgment of 16 November 2000, Donkersteeg, C-37/99, EU:C:2000:636, paragraphs 30 and 31\nFor agricultural products, a ‘technical specification’ is a text defining their required characteristics or production methods. A rule laying down conditions for the vaccination of livestock is a production rule and thus as a ‘technical specification’.\n“30. As pointed out in paragraph 20 above, in accordance with Article 1(1) of the directive, so far as agricultural products are concerned, a 'technical specification’ is one contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product or its production methods and procedures.\n31. A rule such as that contained in Article 2(1) of the VBZA is a technical specification within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the directive. As the Commission rightly maintains, since the precise and detailed rules concerning vaccination against Aujeszky's disease are linked to the production, in the strict sense, of the agricultural product concerned and must be complied with throughout the production cycle, that rule therefore defines a 'procedure’ in the production of that product.”\nJudgment of 8 March 2001, Van der Burg, C-278/99, EU:C:2001:143, paragraph 20\nA regulation which merely prohibits commercial advertising, but which does not lay down the characteristics required of a product does not constitute a ‘technical specification’ and cannot therefore be regarded as a ‘technical regulation’.\n“20. […] Under Article 1(1) of Directive 83/189, for the purposes of the directive a 'technical specification’ is 'a specification contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product’. Technical specifications for the purposes of Directive 83/189 must thus refer to the product as such (see Case C-314/98 Snellers Auto's v Algemeen Directeur van de Dienst Wegverkeer [2000] ECR I-0000, paragraph 38). However, legislation such as Article C.11.1(1) of the Decree, which merely prohibits a marketing method, does not lay down the characteristics required of a product.”\nJudgment of 6 June 2002, Sapod Audic, C-159/00, EU:C:2002:343, paragraphs 30 to 33\nA provision of national law laying down an obligation to identify a packaging constitutes a ‘technical regulation’ to be notified in so far as it entails an obligation to mark or label that packaging.\n“30. Accordingly, since the obligation to identify the packaging prescribed by the second paragraph of Article 4 of Decree No 92-377 does not seem to imply an obligation to mark or label that packaging, that obligation does not appear necessarily to refer to the product or its packaging as such. Interpreted in that way, that provision cannot be said to lay down the characteristics required of a product within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Directive 83/189 and, hence, cannot be regarded as a technical specification (see, in particular, Case C-278/99 Van der Burg [2001] ECR I-2015, paragraph 20).\n31.Nevertheless, it must be observed that under the division of powers provided for in Article 234 EC, it is for the national court to interpret national law, in this case the second paragraph of Article 4 of Decree No 92-377.\n32. Consequently, the Court must also consider the possibility that, in the light of all the factual and legal evidence before the national court, that court will reach the conclusion that the second paragraph of Article 4 of Decree No 92-377 must be interpreted as imposing on producers an obligation to mark or label the packaging, although not specifying what sign must be affixed.\n33. In such an event, it would have to be held that that provision is in fact a technical specification within the meaning of Directive 83/189 and, consequently, that, since the obligation is imposed by decree in the case of marketing of packaged products throughout the national territory, that provision constitutes a technical regulation.”\nJudgement of 8 September 2005, C-500/03, Commission/Portugal, EU:C:2005:515, paragraph 30\nA rule establishing a maximum length and height of recreational craft and limiting its propulsion power is a ‘technical specification’.\n(As the judgement is available only in French and Portuguese, the following text is a translation.)\n“30. It follows from the wording of Article 2(1) of that regulation that it contains technical specifications, within the meaning of point 3 of Article 1 of Directive 98/34, which constitute technical regulations within the meaning of that directive. The requirements contained in that regulation relate to maximum length and height and to the limitation of propulsion power for pleasure craft used for navigation purposes. Those technical limitations apply to all public water lagoons in the public service in Portugal, with the exception of those of the Douro River.”\nJudgment of 8 November 2007, Schwibbert, C-20/05, EU:C:2007:652, paragraphs 35 to 37\nNational provisions introducing the obligation to affix a distinctive sign to products for the purpose of their marketing in a Member State constitute a ‘technical specification’ because they are requirements relating to the marking and labelling of products.\n“35. As the Court has held, the concept of technical specification presupposes that the national measure refers to the product or its packaging as such and thus lays down one of the characteristics required of a product (see, to that effect, Case C‑278/99 van der Burg [2001] ECR I‑2015, paragraph 20; Case C‑390/99 Canal Satélite Digital [2002] ECR I‑607, paragraph 45; and also Sapod Audic, paragraph 30, and Lindberg, paragraph 57).\n36. In the present case, it is clear, as the Advocate General has stated in points 46 and 48 of her Opinion, that the distinctive sign ‘SIAE’, which is intended to inform consumers and the national authorities that the reproductions are lawful, is affixed to the actual medium containing the intellectual work and thus to the product itself. It is not, therefore, correct to maintain, as the Società Italiana degli Autori ed Editori and the Italian Government have done, that that sign relates solely to the intellectual work.\n37. Such a distinctive sign constitutes a ‘technical specification’ within the meaning of Article 1(3) of Directive 98/34, since it falls within the requirements applicable to the products concerned as regards marking or labelling. Therefore, since observance of that specification is compulsory de jure for marketing those products, the specification constitutes a ‘technical regulation’ within the meaning of Article 1(11) of that directive (see, to that effect, Case C‑13/96 Bic Benelux [1997] ECR I‑1753, paragraph 23).”\nJudgment of 14 April 2011, Vlaamse Dierenartsenvereniging and Janssens, C-42/10, C-45/10 and C-57/10, EU:C:2011:253, paragraphs 68 to 70\nThe Directive does not apply to pet passports which cannot be classified as ‘products’ because they cannot be the subject of commercial transactions. National provisions on pet passports are therefore no “technical specification” which must be communicated to the Commission.\n“68. […] the Court has had occasion to point out that only products which can be valued in money and which are capable, as such, of forming the subject of commercial transactions fall within the scope of the free movement of goods (see, to that effect, inter alia, Case 7/68 Commission v Italy [1968] ECR 617, 626, and Case C‑65/05 Commission v Greece [2006] ECR I‑10341, paragraphs 23 to 25).\n69. It is not in dispute that pet passports, since they bear a unique number and identify a specific animal, cannot, as such, be the object of commercial transactions.\n70. Those passports cannot therefore be classified as ‘products’ within the meaning of the case-law of the Court; nor can Directive 98/34 apply to them. Consequently, specifications such as those contained in the Belgian legislation at issue in the main proceedings cannot be classified as technical specifications which, in accordance with Article 8 of that directive, must be communicated in advance to the Commission and, failing that, must not be applied by the national court (see, to that effect, Case C‑20/05 Schwibbert [2007] ECR I‑9447, paragraphs 33 and 44 and the case-law cited).”\nJudgment of 9 June 2011, Intercommunale Intermosane and Fédération de l’industrie et du gaz, C-361/10, EU:C:2011:382, paragraphs 14 to 18\nNational provisions laying down minimum requirements for the construction of electrical installations and the safety of workers do not constitute ‘technical specifications’ as they set general safety and protection objectives without referring directly to a product or its packaging and without defining its characteristics.\n“14. [...] it must be determined whether the national provisions at issue in the main proceedings fall within the first category of technical regulations provided for in Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34, that is to say the concept of ‘technical specification’.\n15. It follows from the case-law that that concept, which is defined in Article 1(3) of the directive, presupposes that the national measure necessarily refers to the product or its packaging as such and thus lays down one of the characteristics required of a product (see Schwibbert, paragraph 35 and case-law cited).\n16. As regards the national provisions at issue in the main proceedings, it must be noted that the minimum requirements relating to the carrying out of certain electrical installations provided for by those provisions seek to ensure the safety of those installations in order to protect the workers using them.\n17. It must be noted that those minimum requirements include requirements and general objectives in relation to safety and protection, without necessarily referring to the product concerned or its packaging as such and thus without laying down the characteristics of that product.\n18. Consequently, the national provisions at issue in the main proceedings do not contain technical specifications within the meaning of Directive 98/34.”\nJudgment of 19 July 2012, Fortuna and Others, C-213/11, C-214/11 and C-217/11, EU:C:2012:495, paragraphs 28 to 30\nNational provisions restricting the operation of low-cost gaming machines outside casinos are not “technical regulations” because they do not refer to the characteristics of gaming machines or their packaging.\n“28. […] in order for a national measure to fall within the first category of technical regulations that is referred to in Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34, that is to say, within the concept of ‘technical specification’, that measure must necessarily refer to the product or its packaging as such and thus lay down one of the characteristics required of a product (see Intercommunale Intermosane and Fédération de l’industrie et du gaz, paragraph 15).\n29. Suffice it to state that the transitional provisions in the Law on games of chance relate to authorisations to carry on an activity relating to gaming on low-prize machines. They do not refer to the low-prize gaming machines or their packaging as such and thus do not lay down their characteristics.\n30. Consequently, the national provisions at issue in the main proceedings do not contain technical specifications within the meaning of Directive 98/34.”\nJudgment of 10 July 2014, Ivansson and Others, C-307/13, EU:C:2014:2058, paragraphs 19 to 23\nA rule establishing a general objective of comfort of poultry and quality of rearing facilities is not a “technical specification” because it does not establish the characteristics of the product and is not precise enough to define a production method.\n“19. It is necessary to state that, in accordance with the case-law, that notion [of technical specification] presupposes that the national measure must necessarily refer to the product or its packaging as such and thus lay down one of the characteristics required of a product (see, to that effect, judgment in Fortuna and Others, EU:C:2012:495, paragraph 28).\n20. In addition, with regard to agricultural products, the Court has stated that a technical specification is one contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product or its production methods and procedures (see, to that effect, judgment in Donkersteeg, C‑37/99, EU:C:2000:636, paragraph 30).\n21. It must be noted, firstly, that although Paragraph 9 of the DSF concerns the comfort and quality of the installations where hens for egg production are kept, namely enriched cages, that provision does not, however, as the Polish Government has pointed out, define the characteristics which the items at issue in the main proceedings must have.\n22. Secondly, even if the view could be taken that that provision relates to a production method in that it refers, as stated in the preceding paragraph, to the keeping of hens for egg production in enriched cages, it must none the less be pointed out that that provision merely makes a general mention of the existence of nests, perches and sand-baths within those installations without, however, specifying the various aspects of that housing system. Paragraph 9 of the DSF does not contain any indication concerning, for example, the dimension, number, temperature, upkeep or functioning of those installations as regards the exposure of the hens for egg production to light or even concerning feeding and watering. In the absence of any specification in Paragraph 9 of the DSF, it cannot be regarded as laying down the production methods and procedures.\n23. Furthermore, it must be noted that, by stating that ‘the housing system shall be such that the mortality rate and behaviour disorders in the hens are kept to a low level’ without any other indication, the first subparagraph of Paragraph 9 of the DSF merely states general objectives in relation to the well-being of hens for egg production, without necessarily referring to the product concerned and thus without laying down the characteristics of that product (see, by analogy, judgment in Intercommunale Intermosane and Fédération de l’Industrie et du gaz, C‑361/10, EU:C:2011:382, paragraph 17).”\nJudgment of 27 October 2016, James Elliott Construction, C-613/14, EU:C:2016:821, paragraph 67\nNational provisions setting out implicit contractual conditions concerning the quality of products sold do not constitute ‘technical specifications’ because they do not define the characteristics of the product concerned.\n“67. In the present case, it is apparent, first, that provisions such as those at issue in the main proceedings, either in themselves, or as interpreted by the Irish courts, do not fall within the concept of ‘technical specification’ within the meaning of Article 1(3) of Directive 98/34. That concept covers only national measures which refer to a product or its packaging as such and thus lay down one of the characteristics required of a product (judgment of 10 July 2014, Ivansson and Others, C-307/13, EU:C:2014:2058, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited). That is clearly not the case for a requirement which applies, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, generally to the sale of all products.”\nJudgment of 1 February 2017, Município de Palmela, C-144/16, EU:C:2017:76, paragraph 30\nA regulation requiring the display, in a leisure area, of information on the maximum capacity of that area does not constitute a ‘technical specification’ because it does not lay down the characteristics of a product.\n“30. […] such a provision does not fall within the category of technical specifications within the meaning of Article 1(3) of Directive 98/34, in so far as it is undisputed that the provisions that lay down the requirements and general objectives in relation to safety and protection, without necessarily referring to the product concerned or its packaging as such and thus without laying down the characteristics of that product, do not constitute technical specifications (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 June 2011, Intercommunale Intermosane and Fédération de l’industrie et du gaz, C‑361/10, EU:C:2011:382, paragraphs 17 and 18).”\nJudgment of 26 September 2018, Van Gennip and Others, C-137/17, EU:C:2018:771, paragraph 38\nNational provisions that make the marketing of products conditional upon the purchaser holding an authorisation do not fall within the concept of a ‘technical specification’, as they do not define the characteristics of the product itself or of its packaging.\n“38. As regards, firstly, the concept of ‘technical specification’, it should be recalled that that concept presupposes that the national measure necessarily refers to the product or its packaging as such and therefore lays down one of the characteristics required of a product, such as the dimensions, the sales description, labelling or marking (judgment of 10 July 2014, Ivansson and Others, C-307/13, EU:C:2014:2058, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited). However, as the Advocate General observed in point 74 of his Opinion, the Belgian legislation does not refer to pyrotechnic articles or their packaging as such, so that that legislation does not lay down one of the required characteristics of these products. Accordingly, that legislation does not constitute a ‘technical specification’, within the meaning of Article 1, point 3, of Directive 98/34.”\nJudgment of 28 May 2020, ECO-WIND Construction, C-727/17, EU:C:2020:393, paragraphs 36 and 37\nA regulation imposing a minimum distance for the installation of wind turbines does not constitute a ‘technical specification’, as it does not lay down the characteristics of the product.\n“36. […], as regards the possible classification of the same requirement as a technical regulation on the basis that it falls within the category of ‘technical specifications’, it should be noted that a technical specification presupposes that the national measure prescribing it refers to the product or its packaging as such and that it therefore lays down one of the characteristics required of that product (judgments of 21 April 2005, Lindberg, C‑267/03, EU:C:2005:246, paragraph 57, and of 19 July 2012, Fortuna and Others, C‑213/11, C‑214/11 and C‑217/11, EU:C:2012:495, paragraph 28).\n37. In the present case, the legislation at issue in the main proceedings merely regulates the installation of wind turbines by laying down a mandatory minimum distance requirement that must be complied with for their installation. Consequently, that legislation does not refer to a product as such, in this case the wind generator, and, therefore, does not lay down one of the characteristics required of that product within the meaning of Article 1(1)(f) of Directive 2015/1535, read in the light of Article 1(1)(c) of that directive.”\nJudgment of 22 October 2020, Sportingbet and Internet Opportunity Entertainment, C-275/19, EU:C:2020:856, paragraphs 42 and 43\nNational legislation that reserves the operation of games of chance to the State and requires licences to be granted only to public companies is not a ‘technical specification’, as it does not define the characteristics required of a product.\n“42. Under Article 1(1) of Directive 83/189 a ‘technical specification’, within the meaning of that directive, is the specification contained in a document which lays down the characteristics required of a product such as levels of quality, performance, safety or dimensions, including the requirements applicable to the product as regards terminology, symbols, testing and test methods, packaging, marking or labelling (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 March 2001, van der Burg, C‑278/99, EU:C:2001:143, paragraph 20).\n43. Since Articles 3 and 9 of Decree-Law No 422/89 lay down concession rules for operating games of chance or gambling and the conditions and zones for exercising that activity, it does not appear that those provisions relate to the characteristics required for a product, within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Directive 83/189, so that they cannot be classified as ‘technical regulations’ within the meaning of Article 1(5) of that directive.”"}
{"doc_title": "Case-law on Directive (EU) 20151535", "chunk": "Other Requirements\n“‘other requirements’ means a requirement, other than a technical specification, imposed on a product for the purpose of protecting, in particular, consumers or the environment, and which affects its life cycle after it has been placed on the market, such as conditions of use, recycling, reuse or disposal, where such conditions can significantly influence the composition or nature of the product or its marketing;”\n(Article 1(1)(d) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535)\nJudgment of 21 April 2005, Lindberg, C-267/03, EU:C:2005:246, paragraphs 68 to 78\nA national ban on certain games of chance may be classified as an ‘other requirement’ if it is such as to influence the composition, nature or marketing of the product. However, if the prohibition leaves no room for the use of the product, it will be described as a prohibition provision (see Part I., Subpart e. ‘Prohibition Provisions’ of this document).\n“68. […] it must be held that a national measure such as the prohibition at issue in the main proceedings seems to be specifically covered by the term ‘other requirements’ inserted by Directive 94/10 in Directive 83/189 in order to widen its scope and that it therefore does not fall within the category of technical specifications.\n69. Such a measure is a requirement imposed in connection with a product, namely gaming machines, essentially for the purpose of the protection of consumers, in this case the players concerned.\n70. Accordingly, a prohibition such as that laid down by the relevant provisions of the amended Law on Lotteries relates to the use of a product within the meaning of Article 1(9) of Directive 83/189.\n71. Moreover, the requirement at issue in the main proceedings is not imposed on gaming machines for the purposes of placing them on the market but concerns their life cycle after they have been placed on the market within the meaning of the definition of ‘other requirements’ set out in Article 1(3) of Directive 83/189.\n72. In order to fall within ‘other requirements’ within the meaning of Article 1(3) of Directive 83/189, a requirement such as the prohibition on the use of the gaming machines at issue in the main proceedings must constitute a ‘condition’, in this case, of use, which can significantly influence the composition or nature of the product or its marketing.\n73. However, the question then arises whether that prohibition must be deemed a ‘condition’ of the use of the product concerned or whether it is, rather, a national measure falling within the third category of technical regulations referred to in Article 1(9) of Directive 83/189, which was also inserted in it by Directive 94/10, namely that of ‘laws … of Member States … prohibiting the manufacture, importation, marketing or use of a product’.\n74. Whether a national measure such as that at issue in the main proceedings falls within one or the other of those two categories of technical regulation depends on the scope of the prohibition laid down by that measure.\n75. In that connection, it is significant that, unlike the second category consisting of other requirements within the meaning of Article 1(3), that third category of technical regulation defined in Article 1(9) of Directive 83/189 does not include the condition that the prohibition in question must be such as to significantly influence the composition or nature of the product or its marketing.\n76. To fall within that third category of technical regulation concerning a prohibition inter alia on use the measures must have a scope which goes well beyond a limitation to certain possible uses of the product in question and must thus not be confined to a mere restriction of its use.\n77. As the Advocate General pointed out in point 70 of his Opinion, that category of technical regulation is particularly intended to cover national measures which leave no room for any use which can reasonably be made of the product concerned other than a purely marginal one. It is for the national court to ascertain whether the prohibition entailed by the national provision at issue in the main proceedings is such a measure.\n78. If it should prove, following such examination by the referring court, that such is not the case in the main proceedings, that national provision would be liable to be deemed an ‘other requirement’ since it is common ground that compliance with that requirement is mandatory de jure for the use of the product in the Member State concerned within the meaning of Article 1(9) of Directive 83/189. However, in that event, it is also for the referring court to verify that the prohibition at issue may significantly influence the composition or nature of the product or its marketing within the meaning of Article 1(3).”\nJudgment of 9 June 2011, Intercommunale Intermosane and Fédération de l’industrie et du gaz, C-361/10, EU:C:2011:382, paragraphs 20 and 21\nNational provisions which lay down minimum requirements for the construction of electrical installations and the safety of workers cannot be classified as ‘other requirements’, since their general nature does not make it possible to significantly influence the composition, nature or marketing of the products concerned.\n“20. According to the case-law, in order to be classified as ‘other requirements’ within the meaning of Article 1(4) of Directive 98/34, the minimum requirements laid down by the provisions at issue must constitute ‘conditions’ which can significantly influence the composition or nature of the product concerned or its marketing (see, to that effect, Lindberg, paragraph 72).\n21. Taking account of the general nature of the said requirements, they cannot amount to such conditions or, consequently, be classified as ‘other requirements’, within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the directive.”\nJudgment of 19 July 2012, Fortuna and Others, C-213/11, C-214/11 and C-217/11, EU:C:2012:495, paragraphs 35, 36 and 40\nNational provisions restricting the operation of gaming machines outside casinos may be classified ‘other requirements’ and hence as ‘technical rules’ if they significantly influence the nature or marketing of the products concerned.\n“35. […] the Court has held that, in order to be classified as ‘other requirements’ within the meaning of Article 1(4) of Directive 98/34, the national measures in question must constitute ‘conditions’ which can significantly influence the composition, the nature or the marketing of the product concerned (see, to this effect, Lindberg, paragraph 72, and Intercommunale Intermosane and Fédération de l’industrie et du gaz, paragraph 20).\n36. In that regard, it is to be observed that the transitional provisions in the Law on games of chance impose conditions liable to affect the marketing of low-prize gaming machines. The prohibition on issuing, extending or amending authorisations for activity relating to gaming on low-prize machines outside casinos is such as to directly affect trade in low-prize gaming machines.”\n“40. […] the answer to the questions referred is that Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34 must be interpreted as meaning that national provisions, such as those of the Law on games of chance, which could have the effect of limiting, or even gradually rendering impossible, the running of gaming on low-prize machines anywhere other than in casinos and gaming arcades are capable of constituting ‘technical regulations’, within the meaning of that provision, the drafts of which must be the subject of communication as provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) of the directive, in so far as it is established that those provisions constitute conditions which can significantly influence the nature or the marketing of the product concerned, which is a matter for the referring court to determine.”\nJudgment of 10 July 2014, Ivansson and Others, C-307/13, EU:C:2014:2058, paragraphs 26 to 28\nA rule establishing a general objective of comfort of poultry and quality of rearing facilities is not an “other requirement” as its general nature is unlikely to affect the composition, nature or marketing of the final product.\n“26. […] the Court has already held that, in order to be classified as ‘other requirements’ within the meaning of Article 1(4) of Directive 98/34, the national measures at issue must constitute ‘conditions’ which can significantly influence the composition or nature of the product concerned or its marketing (see judgment in Fortuna and Others, EU:C:2012:495, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).\n27. The Court has also held that, where the provisions of a national measure are general in nature, they cannot amount to such conditions or, consequently, be classified as ‘other requirements’, within the meaning of Article 1(4) of the directive (see, to that effect, judgment in Intercommunale Intermosane and Fédération de l’Industrie et du gaz, EU:C:2011:382, paragraph 21).\n28. The very general formulation of Paragraph 9 of the DSF, as stated in paragraphs 22 and 23 of the present judgment, thus precludes that provision from being regarded as placing conditions on the composition or nature of the products concerned or their marketing.”\nJudgment of 11 June 2015, Berlington Hungary and Others, C-98/14, EU:C:2015:386, paragraphs 98 and 99\nNational provisions prohibiting the operation of slot machines outside casinos constitute ‘other requirements’ since they may significantly influence the nature or marketing of such machines.\n“98. […] the Court has already held that a national measure which restricts the organisation of certain games of chance to casinos only constitutes a ‘technical regulation’, within the meaning of Article 1(11) of the directive, in so far as it can significantly influence the nature or the marketing of the products used in that context (see, to that effect, judgments in Commission v Greece, C‑65/05, EU:C:2006:673, paragraph 61, and Fortuna and Others, Joined Cases C‑213/11, C‑214/11 and C‑217/11, EU:C:2012:495, paragraphs 24 and 40).\n99. However, a prohibition on operating slot machines outside casinos, such as the one introduced by the amending Law of 2012, can significantly influence the nature or the marketing of those machines, which constitute goods that may be covered by Article 34 TFEU (see judgment in Läärä and Others, C‑124/97, EU:C:1999:435, paragraphs 20 and 24), by reducing the outlets in which they can be used.”\nJudgment of 13 October 2016, Naczelnik Urzędu Celnego I w Ł., C-303/15, EU:C:2016:771, paragraphs 25 to 30\nA provision making the exercise of gambling activities subject to the possession of a casino operating licence does not constitute an ‘other requirement’. Indeed, while provisions that limit the organisation of games of chance to casinos may significantly affect the marketing of related products by reducing their distribution channels, rules governing the conditions for the establishment of undertakings are not likely to have a significant effect on the nature or marketing of the products used.\n“25. Last, in order to determine whether Article 6(1) of the Law on Games of Chance falls within the scope of either Article 1(4) of Directive 98/34 or Article 1(11) of that directive, it must be ascertained whether such a provision can significantly influence the composition, nature or marketing of the product concerned, in this case gaming machines, as a ‘condition’ relating to the use of the product concerned, or whether it is a national measure belonging to the category of prohibitions referred to in Article 1(11) of that directive.\n26. In that regard, it must be borne in mind that it is Article 14(1) of the Law on Games of Chance that restricts the organisation of roulette games, card games, dice games and gaming on machines to gaming casinos. That provision was notified to the Commission as a ‘technical regulation’, in view of the fact that the Court has previously held, first, that a national measure which reserves the organisation of certain games of chance to casinos alone constitutes a ‘technical regulation’, within the meaning of Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34, in so far as it can significantly influence the nature or the marketing of the products used in that context and, second, that a prohibition on operating certain products outside casinos can significantly influence the marketing of those products, by reducing the outlets in which they can be used (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 June 2015, Berlington Hungary and Others, C‑98/14, EU:C:2015:386, paragraphs 98 and 99).\n27. On the other hand, Article 6(1) of that law, which provides that a licence to operate a gaming casino is required for the organisation of roulette games, card games, dice games and gaming on machines, was not notified.\n28.The argument of the Commission, that the close link between the two provisions of national law concerned means that it is impossible to isolate Article 14(1) of the Law on Games of Chance from Article 6(1) of that law, cannot be accepted. As stated by the Advocate General in points 38 to 44 of his Opinion, Article 6(1) of that law and Article 14(1) of that law differ in their function and scope. The description in Article 6(1) of that law, which specifies the authorisation at issue as an authorisation ‘to operate a gaming casino’, does not alter that conclusion.\n29. Accordingly, it must be held that Article 6(1) of the Law on Games of Chance cannot be regarded as falling within the category of ‘other requirements’, within the meaning of Article 1(4) of Directive 98/34, since the authorisation required by that provision of national law for the organisation of games of chance constitutes a condition imposed with respect to the activity of organising such games, as distinct from Article 14(1) of that law, which imposes conditions with respect to the products concerned by prohibiting their use other than in casinos.\n30. Further, in accordance with settled case-law, provisions of national law which merely lay down conditions governing the establishment or provision of services by undertakings, such as provisions making the exercise of a business activity subject to prior authorisation, do not constitute technical regulations within the meaning of Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34 (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 February 2016, Ince, C‑336/14, EU:C:2016:72, paragraph 76 and the case-law cited).”\nJudgment of 27 October 2016, James Elliott Construction, C-613/14, EU:C:2016:821, paragraphs 67 to 69\nNational provisions laying down implicit contractual conditions concerning the marketable quality, fitness for use, or quality of products sold do not constitute ‘other requirements’, as their general nature makes them unlikely to significantly influence the composition, nature, or marketing of the products concerned.\n“67. In the present case, it is apparent, first, that provisions such as those at issue in the main proceedings, either in themselves, or as interpreted by the Irish courts, do not fall within the concept of ‘technical specification’ within the meaning of Article 1(3) of Directive 98/34. That concept covers only national measures which refer to a product or its packaging as such and thus lay down one of the characteristics required of a product (judgment of 10 July 2014, Ivansson and Others, C‑307/13, EU:C:2014:2058, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited). That is clearly not the case for a requirement which applies, unless the parties have agreed otherwise, generally to the sale of all products.\n68. Secondly and for the same reason, those provisions cannot be classified as ‘other requirements’ within the meaning of Article 1(4) of Directive 98/34.\n69. In that regard, the Court has explained that, in order to be classified as ‘other requirements’ within the meaning of that provision, the national measures at issue must constitute conditions which can significantly influence the composition or nature of the product concerned or its marketing, since requirements of a general nature cannot amount to such conditions or, consequently, be classified as ‘other requirements’ (see judgment of 10 July 2014, Ivansson and Others, C‑307/13, EU:C:2014:2058, paragraph 26 and 27 and the case-law cited).”\nJudgment of 1 February 2017, Município de Palmela, C-144/16, EU:C:2017:76, paragraphs 23 and 33\nA provision laying down packaging requirements imposed on a product on the grounds of consumer protection is an “other requirement” because it relates to the life cycle of products after being placed on the market and significantly influences their composition and marketing.\nOn the other hand, a regulation requiring information on the maximum capacity of a leisure area to be displayed in several places in that area is not an ‘other requirement’ because of its general nature.\n“23. As regards Article 16(1) and (2) of the PRA regulation, as amended by Decree-Law No 119/2009, it must be observed, as the referring court noted, that it constitutes a technical regulation within the meaning of Directives 83/189 and 98/34, in so far as that provision lays down requirements imposed on a product, for the purpose of protecting consumers, which affect its life cycle after it has been placed on the market and significantly influence the composition and marketing of such a product. Accordingly, that provision falls within the category of ‘other requirements’ within the meaning of both Article 1(3) of Directive 83/189 and Article 1(4) of Directive 98/34.”\n“33. […] a provision such as that at issue in the main proceedings does not amount to an ‘other requirement’ within the meaning of Article 1(4) of Directive 98/34, taking account of the general nature of the requirements which it sets out (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 June 2011, Intercommunale Intermosane and Fédération de l’industrie et du gaz, C-361/10, EU:C:2011:382, paragraph 21). On the other hand, it does not contain any prohibitions which could bring it within the category of the prohibitions set out in Article 1(11) of that directive.”\nJudgment of 26 September 2018, Van Gennip and Others, C-137/17, EU:C:2018:771, paragraphs 39 and 40\nNational provisions making the marketing of products subject to the condition that the purchaser is in possession of an authorisation do not fall within the concept of ‘other requirements’ because it is a condition imposed not on the products but on purchasers.\n“39. […] as regards the category of ‘other requirements’, it is appropriate to note that, in order to be classified as ‘other requirements’, within the meaning of Article 1, point 4, of Directive 98/34, a national measure must constitute a ‘condition’ which can significantly influence the composition, nature or marketing of the product concerned (judgment of 13 October 2016, M. and S., C‑303/15, EU:C:2016:771, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited).\n40. In that regard, it must be noted, as did the Advocate General in point 76 of his Opinion, that the Belgian legislation makes the sale of pyrotechnic articles of which the pyrotechnic composition exceeds 1 kg subject to the buyer acquiring an authorisation. Thus, the required authorisation does not constitute a requirement in respect of the product concerned, but for potential buyers and, indirectly, for economic operators selling pyrotechnic articles (see, to that effect, judgments of 21 April 2005, Lindberg, C‑267/03, EU:C:2005:246, paragraph 87, and of 13 October 2016, M. and S., C‑303/15, EU:C:2016:771, paragraph 29).”\nJudgment of 28 May 2020, ECO-WIND Construction, C-727/17, EU:C:2020:393, paragraphs 40 and 41\nA regulation imposing a minimum distance for the installation of wind turbines does not fall under the category of ‘other requirements’ because its impact on the marketing of the products concerned is not sufficiently direct.\n“40. […] it is apparent from settled case-law that that category includes legislation which lays down a condition capable of significantly influencing the composition, nature or marketing of a product (judgments of 21 April 2005, Lindberg, C‑267/03, EU:C:2005:246, paragraphs 69 to 72, and of 19 July 2012, Fortuna and Others, C‑213/11, C‑214/11 and C‑217/11, EU:C:2012:495, paragraph 35), those ‘other requirements’ covering the requirements arising from consideration of the life cycle of the product in question after it has been placed on the market and relating, in particular, to its use.\n41. In the present case, as was found in paragraph 37 of the present judgment, it should be noted that the requirement that the installation of a wind turbine is subject to the condition of a minimum distance between it and buildings with a residential function has no direct connection with the composition, nature or marketing of a product such as a wind generator. In that regard, even if that requirement were to lead to a restriction of the locations suitable for the installation of wind turbines, and therefore that it had an effect on the marketing of wind generators, that effect would not be sufficiently direct for that requirement to fall within the category of ‘other requirements’ set out in Article 1(1)(f) of Directive 2015/1535.”\nJudgment of 4 November 2022, Phytofar, C-658/21, EU:C:2022:925, paragraphs 36 to 42\nLegislation prohibiting persons who do not hold an authorisation for professionals from using pesticides containing glyphosate is likely to constitute an ‘other requirement’, since it could significantly influence the marketing of glyphosate. The significance of that influence is assessed in the light of the volume of purchases of the products concerned and the changes in sales habits.\n“36. In the present case, it is apparent, first of all, from the preamble to the Decision of 14 July 2017 that the prohibition laid down by it is imposed in order to protect human health and the environment.\n37. Next, that prohibition concerns the life cycle of pesticides containing glyphosate after they have been placed on the market, by laying down a condition relating to the use of those products, in that, on land in private use, only professionals who have a phytosanitary licence are authorised to use them.\n38. Lastly, it must be observed that such a prohibition is liable to influence the marketing of the products concerned.\n39. That measure results in the disappearance of a category of potential purchasers of pesticides containing glyphosate, namely individuals who wish to use such pesticides themselves, without making use of the services of professionals who have the required phytosanitary licence. Such a restriction on the possibility of using pesticides containing glyphosate thus affects their marketing (see, by analogy, judgment of 13 October 2016, M. and S., C‑303/15, EU:C:2016:771, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).\n40. However, as the Commission states in its written observations, in order for the measure introduced by the Decision of 14 July 2017 to be classified as a ‘technical regulation’, falling within the category of ‘other requirements’ within the meaning of Article 1(1)(d) and (f) of Directive 2015/1535, the marketing of pesticides containing glyphosate must be ‘significantly’ influenced by that measure.\n41. It is for the referring court to determine whether that is the case here.\n42. In making that assessment, the referring court may take into account, inter alia, the overall volume of sales of pesticides containing glyphosate in the territory of the Flemish Region and the change in the purchasing habits of each category of purchaser, on the basis of the frequency of their purchases and the quantity of product purchased, as well as the change in the places of purchase and distribution channels. In that context, that court may take into consideration the extent to which, on the one hand, demand from professional users replaces that of individuals who make use of the services of professional users and, on the other hand, individual users now obtain glyphosate-free pesticides instead of those containing that substance.”\nJudgment of 9 March 2023, Vapo Atlantic, C-604/21, EU:C:2023:175, paragraphs 40 and 41\nNational legislation requiring operators who release motor fuels for consumption to contribute to meeting targets for the incorporation of biofuels into motor fuels and the breach of which may lead to financial sanctions can significantly influence the marketing of fuels. It therefore constitutes an ‘other requirement’.\n“40. In the present case, the referring court’s questions concern a national law which requires economic operators that release motor fuels for consumption, with the exception of LPG and natural gas, to contribute to compliance with the targets for the incorporation of biofuels in the annual quantities of motor fuel which they release for consumption, namely a target of 10% for 2020. Even though that law does not specify the type of motor fuel in question nor does it fix a percentage of biofuel to be physically incorporated into motor fuels, nor specify the type of biofuel to be incorporated, the requirement it lays down, adopted for environmental protection purposes, is aimed at the life cycle of motor fuels after they have been placed on the market and could significantly influence the marketing of those products, in that failure to comply with the obligation to incorporate biofuels laid down by that law may result in an obligation to pay financial compensation being imposed.\n41. It follows that a national law which sets a target for the incorporation of 10% of biofuels into motor fuels released for consumption by an economic operator in respect of 2020 is covered by the concept of ‘other requirements’ within the meaning of Article 1(4) of Directive 98/34 and thus constitutes a ‘technical regulation’ within the meaning of Article 1(11) of that directive.”"}
{"doc_title": "Case-law on Directive (EU) 20151535", "chunk": "Rules on Services\n“‘rule on services’ means a requirement of a general nature relating to the taking-up and pursuit of service activities within the meaning of point (b), in particular provisions concerning the service provider, the services and the recipient of services, excluding any rules which are not specifically aimed at the services defined in that point.\nFor the purposes of this definition:\na rule shall be considered to be specifically aimed at Information Society services where, having regard to its statement of reasons and its operative part, the specific aim and object of all or some of its individual provisions is to regulate such services in an explicit and targeted manner;\na rule shall not be considered to be specifically aimed at Information Society services if it affects such services only in an implicit or incidental manner;”\n(Article 1(1)(e) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535)\n“‘service’ means any Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services.\nFor the purposes of this definition:\n(i) ‘at a distance’ means that the service is provided without the parties being simultaneously present;\n(ii) ‘by electronic means’ means that the service is sent initially and received at its destination by means of electronic equipment for the processing (including digital compression) and storage of data, and entirely transmitted, conveyed and received by wire, by radio, by optical means or by other electromagnetic means;\n(iii) ‘at the individual request of a recipient of services’ means that the service is provided through the transmission of data on individual request.\nAn indicative list of services not covered by this definition is set out in Annex I;”\n(Article 1(1)(b) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535)\n“Indicative list of services not covered by the second subparagraph of Article 1(1)(b)\nServices not provided ‘at a distance’\nServices provided in the physical presence of the provider and the recipient, even if they involve the use of electronic devices:\n(a) medical examinations or treatment at a doctor's surgery using electronic equipment where the patient is physically present;\n(b) consultation of an electronic catalogue in a shop with the customer on site;\n(c) plane ticket reservation at a travel agency in the physical presence of the customer by means of a network of computers;\n(d) electronic games made available in a video arcade where the customer is physically present.\nServices not provided ‘by electronic means’\n— services having material content even though provided via electronic devices:\n(a) automatic cash or ticket dispensing machines (banknotes, rail tickets);\n(b) access to road networks, car parks, etc., charging for use, even if there are electronic devices at the entrance/exit controlling access and/or ensuring correct payment is made,\n— offline services: distribution of CD-ROMs or software on diskettes,\n— services which are not provided via electronic processing/inventory systems:\n(a) voice telephony services;\n(b) telefax/telex services;\n(c) services provided via voice telephony or fax;\n(d) telephone/telefax consultation of a doctor;\n(e) telephone/telefax consultation of a lawyer;\n(f) telephone/telefax direct marketing.\n3. Services not supplied ‘at the individual request of a recipient of services’\nServices provided by transmitting data without individual demand for simultaneous reception by an unlimited number of individual receivers (point to multipoint transmission):\n(a) television broadcasting services (including near-video on-demand services), covered by point (e) of Article 1(1) of Directive 2010/13/EU;\n(b) radio broadcasting services;\n(c) (televised) teletext.”\n(Annex I to Directive (EU) 2015/1535)\nJudgment of 2 June 2005, Mediakabel BV, C-89/04, EU:C:2005:348, paragraphs 38 and 39\nA television broadcasting service made available at the subscriber's request, but for which the frequency and timing of movies are determined by the provider, does not constitute an “information society service”, as the content is selected and scheduled by the provider and therefore not supplied at the individual request of the recipient.\n“38. Although such a service fulfils the first two criteria for constituting an ‘information society service’ within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Directive 98/34, that is, it is provided at a distance and transmitted in part by electronic equipment, it does not meet the third criterion of the concept, according to which the service in question must be provided ‘at the individual request of a recipient of services’. The list of films offered as part of a service such as Filmtime is determined by the service provider. That selection of films is offered to all subscribers on the same terms, either through written media or through information transmitted on the television screen, and those films are accessible at the broadcast times determined by the provider. The individual key allowing access to the films is only a means of unencoding images the signals of which are sent simultaneously to all subscribers.\n39. Such a service is thus not commanded individually by an isolated recipient who has free choice of programmes in an interactive setting. It must be considered to be a near-video on-demand service, provided on a ‘point to multipoint’ basis and not ‘at the individual request of a recipient of services’.”\nJudgment of 2 February 2016, Ince, C-336/14, EU:C:2016:72, paragraphs 75 and 76\nNational provisions restricting the offering of online games of chance or prohibiting the online advertising of such games may be considered “rules on services”, as they concern an “information society service.” By contrast, provisions requiring prior authorisation for operators organising games of chance or prohibiting such authorisation from being granted to private operators, relate to the conditions for the establishment of undertakings and therefore do not constitute “rules on services.”\n“75. […], some of the provisions of the Treaty on gaming may be categorised as ‘rules on services’, in so far as they concern an ‘Information Society service’ within the meaning of Article 1.2 of Directive 98/34. Those provisions include the prohibition of offering games of chance on the internet laid down in Paragraph 4(4) of the Treaty on gaming, the exceptions to that prohibition listed in Paragraph 25(6) of that treaty, the restrictions placed on offering sporting bets via telemedia services under Paragraph 21(2) of that treaty, and the prohibition of broadcasting advertisements for games of chance on the internet or via telecommunications equipment pursuant to Paragraph 5(3) of that treaty.\n76. With regard, by contrast, to the provisions of the Treaty on gaming other than those relating to an ‘Information Society service’, within the meaning of Article 1.2 of Directive 98/34, such as the provisions introducing the obligation to obtain an authorisation to organise or collect sporting bets and the impossibility of issuing such an authorisation to private operators, these do not constitute ‘technical regulations’ within the meaning of Article 1.11 of that directive. National provisions which merely lay down conditions governing the establishment or provision of services by undertakings, such as provisions making the exercise of an activity subject to prior authorisation, do not constitute technical regulations within the meaning of that provision (see, to that effect, judgment in Lindberg, C‑267/03, EU:C:2005:246, paragraph 87).”\nJudgment of the Court of 13 October 2016, Naczelnik Urzędu Celnego I w., C-303/15, EU:C:2016:771, paragraph 24\nA provision making the exercise of gambling activities subject to the holding of a casino operating licence does not constitute a ‘rule on services’, as it does not concern an ‘information society service’.\n“24. […] that provision cannot be placed in the category of ‘rules on [information society] services’, within the meaning of Article 1(5) of Directive 98/34, since it does not relate to an ‘Information society service’, within the meaning of Article 1(2) of that directive.”\nJudgment of 20 December 2017, Falbert and Others, C-255/16, EU:C:2017:983, paragraphs 27 to 29, 32 and 33\nNational provisions on gaming or advertising services may constitute ‘rules on services’ if they directly concern services provided at a distance, by electronic means, and at the individual request of the recipient. Even if the wording of such provisions does not differentiate between online and offline services, their objective with respect to ‘information society services’ may be inferred from their recitals or the travaux préparatoires.\n“27. It should be borne in mind that, under Article 1(2) of that directive, the concept of a ‘technical regulation’ covers solely regulations relating to information society services, that is, any service provided at a distance by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services (see judgments of 13 October 2016, M. and S., C‑303/15, EU:C:2016:771, paragraph 21, and 1 February 2017, Município de Palmela, C‑144/16, EU:C:2017:76, paragraph 28).\n28. It should be noted in that regard that, in principle, Paragraph 10(3)(3) of the Law on gaming concerns two types of services being, on the one hand, advertising services, which are immediately sanctioned under that provision and, on the other, gaming services covered by the prohibition on advertising and which are the principal subject-matter of the Law on gaming, read as a whole.\n29. Both advertising services and gaming services, in so far as they are provided, inter alia, by electronic means (online), constitute ‘Information Society services’ within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Directive 98/34 and the rules relating thereto which may accordingly be held to be ‘rules on services’ within the meaning of Article 1(5) of Directive 98/34.”\n“32. It should be noted in that regard, firstly, that under the first indent of Article 1(5) of Directive 98/34, the question whether a rule is aimed specifically at information society services must be determined in the light of both the stated reasons and the wording of the rule. Under that same provision, moreover, it is not required that ‘the specific aim and object’ of all of the rule in question be to regulate information society services, as it is sufficient that the rule pursue that aim or object in certain of its provisions.\n33. Consequently, if it is not apparent solely from the wording of a national rule that it is aimed, at least in part, at regulating specifically information society services – such as in the present case, where the wording does not draw any distinction between services provided offline and services provided online – that object may nevertheless be gleaned quite readily from the stated reasons given for the rule – again as in the present case under the relevant national rules of interpretation, which allow for inter alia the travaux préparatoires for the rule to provide guidance.”\nJudgment of 20 December 2017, Asociación Profesional Elite Taxi, C-434/15, EU:C:2017:981, paragraphs 37 and 39 to 41\nAn intermediation service that connects, via a smartphone application and for remuneration, non-professional drivers using their own vehicles with persons seeking urban transport must be regarded as intrinsically linked to a transport service and, therefore, classified as a ‘service in the field of transport’ (not as an ‘information society service’).\n“37. It is appropriate to observe, however, that a service such as that in the main proceedings is more than an intermediation service consisting of connecting, by means of a smartphone application, a non-professional driver using his or her own vehicle with a person who wishes to make an urban journey.”\n“39. In that regard, it follows from the information before the Court that the intermediation service provided by Uber is based on the selection of non-professional drivers using their own vehicle, to whom the company provides an application without which (i) those drivers would not be led to provide transport services and (ii) persons who wish to make an urban journey would not use the services provided by those drivers. In addition, Uber exercises decisive influence over the conditions under which that service is provided by those drivers. On the latter point, it appears, inter alia, that Uber determines at least the maximum fare by means of the eponymous application, that the company receives that amount from the client before paying part of it to the non-professional driver of the vehicle, and that it exercises a certain control over the quality of the vehicles, the drivers and their conduct, which can, in some circumstances, result in their exclusion.\n40. That intermediation service must thus be regarded as forming an integral part of an overall service whose main component is a transport service and, accordingly, must be classified not as ‘an information society service’ within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Directive 98/34, to which Article 2(a) of Directive 2000/31 refers, but as ‘a service in the field of transport’ within the meaning of Article 2(2)(d) of Directive 2006/123.\n41. That classification is indeed confirmed by the case-law of the Court, according to which the concept of ‘services in the field of transport’ includes not only transport services in themselves but also any service inherently linked to any physical act of moving persons or goods from one place to another by means of transport (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 October 2015, Grupo Itevelesa and Others, C‑168/14, EU:C:2015:685, paragraphs 45 and 46, and Opinion 2/15 (Free Trade Agreement with Singapore) of 16 May 2017, EU:C:2017:376, paragraph 61).”\nJudgment of 10 April 2018, Uber France, C-320/16, EU:C:2018:221, paragraphs 21 and 22\nA provision of national law that imposes criminal penalties for organising a system to connect customers with drivers, without the necessary authorisation, concerns a ‘service in the field of transport’ (and not an ‘information society service’) insofar the intermediation service to which it applies forms an integral part of an overall service whose main component is the transport service.\n“21. […] the Court found that the intermediation service provided by the company concerned was inherently linked to the offer by that company of non-public urban transport services, in view of the fact that, in the first place, that company provided an application without which those drivers would not have been led to provide transport services, and the persons who wished to make an urban journey would not have used the services provided by those drivers and, in the second place, that company exercised decisive influence over the conditions under which services were provided by those drivers, inter alia by determining the maximum fare, by collecting that fare from the customer before paying part of it to the non-professional driver of the vehicle, and by exercising a certain control over the quality of the vehicles, the drivers and their conduct, which could, in some circumstances, result in their exclusion (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 December 2017, Asociación Profesional Elite Taxi, C‑434/15, EU:C:2017:981, paragraphs 38 and 39).\n22. The Court found, on the basis of those factors, that the intermediation service at issue in that case had to be regarded as forming an integral part of an overall service the main component of which was a transport service and, accordingly, had to be classified, not as an ‘information society service’ within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Directive 98/34, but as a ‘service in the field of transport’ within the meaning of Article 2(2)(d) of Directive 2006/123 (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 December 2017, Asociación Profesional Elite Taxi, C‑434/15, EU:C:2017:981, paragraph 40).”\nJudgment of 26 September 2018, Van Gennip and Others, C-137/17, EU:C:2018:771, paragraphs 42 and 43\nNational provisions making the marketing of products conditional on the purchaser holding an authorisation do not fall within the concept of a ‘rule on services’, as they do not concern ‘information society services’.\n“42. Concerning, thirdly, the category ‘rule on services’, it must be recalled that, under Article 1, point 5, of Directive 98/34, such a rule constitutes any requirement of a general nature relating to the taking-up and pursuit of services referred to in Article 1, point 2, of that directive, which designate ‘any Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services’ (judgment of 4 February 2016, Ince, C‑336/14, EU:C:2016:72, paragraph 74).\n43. In the present case, it must be held, as the Advocate General stated in point 73 of his Opinion, that the legislation at issue in the main proceedings does not involve Information Society services, within the meaning of Article 1, point 2, of Directive 98/34. Accordingly, that legislation cannot fall within the category ‘rule on services’ of the Information Society, within the meaning of Article 1, point 5, of that directive.”\nJudgment of 12 September 2019, VG Media, C-299/17, EU:C:2019:716, paragraphs 32, 33 and 36\nA national provision prohibiting commercial operators of search engines and providers of commercial content services from making newspapers available to the public constitutes a ‘technical regulation’ and must be notified to the Commission.\nA rule is considered to be specifically aimed at ‘information society services’ if certain provisions pursue that objective, even if it is not the rule’s exclusive aim. That objective may be inferred from the stated reasons given for the rule, which can appear in the travaux préparatoires, even if they are not explicitly apparent from the wording of the rule itself.\n“32. In that regard it should be noted that under the first indent of Article 1(5) of that directive, a rule shall be considered as specifically aimed at information society services having regard to both its statement of reasons and its operative part. Under that same provision, moreover, it is not required that ‘the specific aim and object’ of all of the rule in question be to regulate information society services, as it is sufficient that the rule pursue that aim or object in some of its provisions (judgment of 20 December 2017, Falbert and Others, C‑255/16, EU:C:2017:983, paragraph 32).\n33. In addition, even where it is not apparent solely from the wording of a national rule that it is aimed, at least in part, at regulating information society services specifically, that object may nevertheless be gleaned quite readily from the stated reasons given for the rule, as they appear, in accordance with the relevant national rules of interpretation in that regard, inter alia from the travaux préparatoires for the rule (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 December 2017, Falbert and Others, C‑255/16, EU:C:2017:983, paragraph 33).”\n“36. Although the referring court does not provide any clear indications as to the specific aim and object of the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, it is, however, apparent from the observations submitted by the German Government at the hearing before the Court that, initially, the amendment of the UrhG specifically concerned internet search engine providers. Moreover, the parties to the main proceedings and the Commission state, in their written observations, that the purpose of that legislation was to protect the legitimate interests of publishers of newspapers and magazines in the digital world. It appears, therefore, that the main aim and object of the national provision at issue in the main proceedings was to protect those publishers from copyright infringements by online search engines. In that context, protection appears to have been considered necessary only for systematic infringements of works of online publishers by information society service providers.”\nJudgment of 19 December 2019, Airbnb Ireland, C-390/18, EU:C:2019:1112, paragraphs 64 to 68 and 99\nAn intermediation service connecting customers with hosts offering short-term accommodation via an electronic platform, while providing ancillary services, constitutes an ‘information society service’ because the ancillary services do not confer a significant influence over the provision of the accommodation services.\nFor a service to be classified as an ‘information society service’, it must cumulatively meet four conditions: it must be provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means, and at the individual request of the recipient.\n“64. Even taken together, the services, optional or otherwise, provided by Airbnb Ireland and referred to in paragraphs 59 to 63 above, do not call into question the separate nature of the intermediation service provided by that company and therefore its classification as an ‘information society service’, since they do not substantially modify the specific characteristics of that service. In that regard, it is also paradoxical that such added-value ancillary services provided by an electronic platform to its customers, in particular to distinguish itself from its competitors, may, in the absence of additional elements, result in the nature and therefore the legal classification of that platform’s activity being modified, as was observed by the Advocate General in point 46 of his Opinion.\n65. Furthermore, and contrary to what AHTOP and the French Government maintain, the rules for the functioning of an intermediation service such as the one provided by Airbnb cannot be equated to those of the intermediation service which gave rise to the judgments of 20 December 2017, Asociación Profesional Elite Taxi (C‑434/15, EU:C:2017:981, paragraph 39), and of 10 April 2018, Uber France (C‑320/16, EU:C:2018:221, paragraph 21).\n66. Apart from the fact that those judgments were given in the specific context of urban passenger transport to which Article 58(1) TFEU applies and that the services provided by Airbnb Ireland are not comparable to those that were at issue in the cases giving rise to the judgments referred to in the previous paragraph, the ancillary services referred to in paragraphs 59 to 63 above do not provide evidence for the same level of control found by the Court in those judgments.\n67. Thus, the Court stated in those judgments that Uber exercised decisive influence over the conditions under which transport services were provided by the non-professional drivers using the application made available to them by that company (judgments of 20 December 2017, Asociación Profesional Elite Taxi, C‑434/15, EU:C:2017:981, paragraph 39, and of 10 April 2018, Uber France, C‑320/16, EU:C:2018:221, paragraph 21).\n68. The matters mentioned by the referring court and recalled in paragraph 19 above do not establish that Airbnb Ireland exercises such a decisive influence over the conditions for the provision of the accommodation services to which its intermediation service relates, particularly since Airbnb Ireland does not determine, directly or indirectly, the rental price charged, as was established in paragraphs 56 and 62 above, still less does it select the hosts or the accommodation put up for rent on its platform.”\n“99. Bearing in mind that the French Republic did not give notification of the Hoguet Law and given the cumulative nature of the conditions laid down in Article 3(4) of Directive 2000/31, recalled in paragraphs 84 and 85 above, the view must be taken that that law cannot, on any view, be applied to an individual in a situation like that of Airbnb Ireland in the main proceedings, regardless of whether that law satisfies the other conditions laid down in that provision.”\nJudgment of 22 October 2020, Sportingbet and Internet Opportunity Entertainment, C-275/19, EU:C:2020:856, paragraphs 47 to 49\nLegislation conferring on a public entity the exclusive right to operate certain games of chance, including on the internet, falls within the definition of ‘rules on services’ in so far as they concern an information society service.\n“47. According to Article 1(5) of that directive, ‘rules on services’ consist of every requirement of a general nature relating to the taking-up and pursuit of the service activities referred to in Article 1(2) of that directive, which include ‘any Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services’.\n48. In that regard, the Court has already held that provisions relating to the prohibition of offering games of chance on the internet, the exceptions to that prohibition, the restrictions placed on offering sporting bets on the internet and the prohibition of broadcasting advertisements for games of chance on the internet may be classified as ‘rules on services’ for the purposes of Article 1(5) of Directive 98/34, in so far as they concern an ‘Information Society service’ for the purposes of Article 1(2) of that directive (see, by analogy, judgment of 4 February 2016, Ince, C‑336/14, EU:C:2016:72, paragraph 75).\n49. In the present case, the rules laid down in Articles 2 and 3 of Decree-Law 282/2003 specifically refer to Information Society services. In addition, as a result of the award to Santa Casa of the exclusive right to operate games of chance on the internet, those provisions prohibit all economic operators from providing those services, with the exception of Santa Casa.”\nJudgment of 3 December 2020, Star Taxi App, C-62/19, EU:C:2020:980, paragraphs 52 to 54 and 64 to 66\nAn intermediation service that merely connects customers with already authorised taxi drivers - without organising the transport service itself, selecting drivers, setting fares, or exercising control over vehicles or drivers - falls within the category of ‘information society services’.\nMoreover, legislation that does not specifically target such services but applies indiscriminately to all forms of dispatching, including by telephone or via an application, cannot be classified as a ‘rule on services’.\n“52. First, it is apparent from the order for reference that, unlike the intermediation service at issue in the case which gave rise to the judgment of 20 December 2017, Asociación Profesional Elite Taxi (C‑434/15, EU:C:2017:981), which offered and rendered accessible urban transport services operated by non-professional drivers previously absent from the market, the service at issue in the main proceedings is confined, as the Advocate General observed in point 49 of his Opinion, to putting persons wishing to make urban journeys in touch solely with authorised taxi drivers already engaged in that activity and for whom the intermediation service is merely one of a number of methods of acquiring customers, and not one, moreover, which they are in any way obliged to use.\n53. Secondly, such an intermediation service cannot be regarded as organising the general operation of the urban transport service subsequently provided, since the service provider does not select the taxi drivers, or determine or receive the fare for the journey, or exercise control over the quality of the vehicles and their drivers or the drivers’ conduct.\n54. It follows that an intermediation service such as that provided by Star Taxi App cannot be regarded as an integral part of an overall service whose main component is a transport service and is, accordingly, to be classified as an ‘information society service’ within the meaning of Article 2(a) of Directive 2000/31.”\n“64. In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the Romanian legislation at issue in the main proceedings, whether Law No 38/2003 or Decision No 178/2008, does not make any reference to information society services. Furthermore, Article 3, Article 21(1) and (31) and Article 41(21) of Annex I to Decision No 178/2008 relate indiscriminately to all types of dispatching services, whether supplied by telephone or any other means, such as a software application.\n65. Furthermore, as the Advocate General pointed out in point 108 of his Opinion, Law No 38/2003 requires providers of dispatching services operating by means of a smartphone application, just like all other providers of dispatching services, to possess equipment, in this case two-way radios, which, given the technology used to provide the service, serves no useful purpose.\n66. Accordingly, since it is not specifically aimed at information society services, regulations such as those at issue in the main proceedings affect such services only in an implicit or incidental manner. Such a rule cannot, therefore, be regarded as a ‘rule on services’ within the meaning of Article 1(1)(e) of Directive 2015/1535, or, consequently, as a ‘technical regulation’ within the meaning of Article 1(1)(f) of that directive.”\nJudgment of 29 February 2024, Doctipharma SAS, C-606/21, EU:C:2024:179, paragraphs 26 to 30 and 34 to 36\nRemuneration for a service supplied by a service provider in the course of an economic activity does not necessarily have to be paid by the persons who are the beneficiaries. This applies to a service provided on a website, consisting of connecting pharmacists and customers for the sale of medicinal products, where the service is remunerated by the pharmacists who subscribed to its platform on the basis of a fixed fee.\nSuch a service is not a part of an overall service whose main element is subject to another legal classification than of ‘information society service’.\n“26. […] Article 1(2) of Directive 98/34 and Article 1(1)(b) of Directive 2015/1535 define the concept of ‘information society service’ as meaning ‘any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services’.\n27. In the present case, with regard to the first condition set out in those provisions, it should be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, remuneration for a service supplied by a service provider in the course of an economic activity does not necessarily have to be paid by the persons who are the beneficiaries (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 September 2016, Mc Fadden, C‑484/14, EU:C:2016:689, paragraph 41, and of 4 May 2017, Vanderborght, C‑339/15, EU:C:2017:335, paragraph 36).\n28. Thus, for the purposes of classifying a service such as that at issue in the main proceedings as falling within the concept of an ‘information society service’ within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Directive 98/34 and Article 1(1)(b) of Directive 2015/1535, it is irrelevant whether that service is provided free of charge to the person purchasing the non-prescription medicinal product, if it gives rise to the conclusion between the provider of that service and each pharmacist using that service of a contract for the provision of services involving payment.\n29. Similarly, it is irrelevant in that regard that, as Doctipharma indicated, it was, under the general terms and conditions of sale, remunerated by the pharmacists who subscribed to its platform on the basis of a fixed fee or, as the French Government indicated, the fact that the service provided by Doctipharma was subject to a monthly subscription paid to Doctipharma by client pharmacists and a retrocession of a percentage of the amount of sales, deducted by the platform.\n30. It follows that, subject to the verifications to be carried out by the referring court, the service at issue in the main proceedings must, in any event, be regarded as having been provided for remuneration.”\n“34. That conclusion is not called into question by the case-law established by the Court in the judgments of 20 December 2017, Asociación Profesional Elite Taxi (C‑434/15, EU:C:2017:981), of 19 December 2019, Airbnb Ireland (C‑390/18, EU:C:2019:1112), and of 3 December 2020, Star Taxi App (C‑62/19, EU:C:2020:980).\n35. It follows from that case-law that a service whose purpose is to connect customers with providers of another service of a different nature and which fulfils all the conditions laid down in Article 1(2) of Directive 98/34 and Article 1(1)(b) of Directive 2015/1535 must be classified as an ‘information society service’ where such a service is distinct from the service of a different nature supplied by those service providers. However, the situation must be different if it is apparent that that service which connects sellers with customers forms an integral part of an overall service, the main element of which is subject to a legal classification other than that of ‘information society service’ (judgment of 3 December 2020, Star Taxi App, C‑62/19, EU:C:2020:980, paragraph 49 and the case-law cited).\n36. As the Advocate General pointed out in paragraphs 28 and 29 of his Opinion, a service for connecting pharmacists and customers for the purpose of selling non-prescription medicinal products from the websites of pharmacies which have subscribed to that service is not capable of forming an integral part of an overall service, the main element of which does not qualify as an ‘information society service’.”\nJudgment of 13 March 2025, Unigames UAB, C-120/24, EU:C:2025:174, paragraphs 38 to 42\nThe prohibition on advertising games of chance on gaming sites does not concern an advertising service independent of the gambling service, but rather a service inseparable from the online gambling service. Consequently, in order to determine whether it constitutes a ‘rule on services’, it is necessary to first consider the classification of online gaming services as ‘information society services’.\n“38. The considerations set out in paragraphs 36 and 37 of the present judgment [according to which online gambling services are to be considered as “information society services”] are not called into question by the fact that the information on gambling published by the gambling operator on its website is not necessarily provided ‘at the individual request of a recipient of services’. That publication of information cannot, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, be regarded as an advertising service or other service provided to recipients of the remote gambling services, but constitutes an activity that is ancillary to and inseparable from the remote gambling services concerned from which it derives all of its economic meaning (see, by analogy, judgment of 1 October 2020, A (Advertising and sale of medicinal products online), C‑649/18, EU:C:2020:764, paragraph 56). Therefore, it is only the gambling services themselves which must meet the relevant conditions in order to fall within the concept of ‘service’, within the meaning of Article 1(1)(b) of Directive 2015/1535, and the prohibition at issue in the main proceedings, which relates to such a publication of information, must, for its part, satisfy the specific criteria laid down in Article 1(1)(e) of that directive in order to be regarded as a ‘rule on’ those services, within the meaning of the latter provision.\n39. In the latter regard, while it is common ground that the prohibition at issue in the main proceedings constitutes ‘a requirement of a general nature’ within the meaning of Article 1(1)(e) of Directive 2015/1535, it must still be examined, first, whether it may be regarded as ‘relating to the taking-up and pursuit of service activities’, that provision stating that that is the case, in particular, with regard to provisions concerning the service provider, the services and the recipient of services.\n40. In that regard, it must be stated that Article 10(19) of the Law on gambling is capable of falling within the concept of a ‘rule on services’, in that it lays down a prohibition on encouraging, inter alia, participation in remote gambling and, in particular, on publishing information relating to gambling on the website of a gambling operator or performing acts encouraging participation in gambling (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 October 2020, Sportingbet and Internet Opportunity Entertainment, C‑275/19, EU:C:2020:856, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).\n41. Second, as is apparent from the very wording of Article 1(1)(e) of Directive 2015/1535, in order to be classified as a ‘rule on services’, the prohibition at issue in the main proceedings must be ‘specifically’ aimed at Information Society services (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 September 2019, VG Media, C‑299/17, EU:C:2019:716, paragraph 31).\n42. In that regard, it follows from point (i) of the second subparagraph of Article 1(1)(e) of Directive 2015/1535 that the verification that a rule is specifically aimed at Information Society services must be carried out in the light of both the wording of that rule and the aim it pursues. Furthermore, under that provision, it is not required that ‘the specific aim and object’ of all of the rule in question be to regulate Information Society services, but it is sufficient that it pursue that aim or object by means of some of its provisions (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 September 2019, VG Media, C‑299/17, EU:C:2019:716, paragraph 32 and the case-law cited). Last, in accordance with point (ii) of the second subparagraph of Article 1(1)(e) of that directive, a rule is not to be considered to be specifically aimed at Information Society services if it affects such services only in an implicit or incidental manner.”"}
{"doc_title": "Case-law on Directive (EU) 20151535", "chunk": "Prohibition Provisions\n“‘technical regulation’ means […] laws, regulations or administrative provisions of Member States, except those provided for in Article 7, prohibiting the manufacture, importation, marketing or use of a product or prohibiting the provision or use of a service, or establishment as a service provider.”\n(first sentence of Article 1(1)(f) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535)\nJudgment of 16 September 1996, Commission v Italy, C-279/94, EU:C:1997:396, paragraph 30\nThe ban on the placing on the market and use of asbestos is a notifiable ‘technical regulation’ to be notified because it prohibits the marketing and use of a product.\n“30. As far as Article 1(2) of Law No 257/92 is concerned, that provision prohibits the extraction, importation, exportation, marketing and production of asbestos, asbestos products and products containing asbestos after a period of one year after the date of entry into force of the Law. Such a provision, in prohibiting the marketing and use of asbestos, constitutes a technical regulation which the Italian Government ought to have notified in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) of the Directive.”\nJudgment of 21 April 2005, Lindberg, C-267/03, EU:C:2005:246, paragraphs 75 to 77\nA national prohibition concerning certain games of chance may be classified as a prohibition provision if it leaves no room for any use which can reasonably be made of the product concerned other than a purely marginal one. On the other hand, classification as a prohibition does not depend on the effect of the prohibition on the composition, nature or marketing of the products concerned.\n“75. In that connection, it is significant that, unlike the second category consisting of other requirements within the meaning of Article 1(3), that third category of technical regulation defined in Article 1(9) of Directive 83/189 does not include the condition that the prohibition in question must be such as to significantly influence the composition or nature of the product or its marketing.\n76. To fall within that third category of technical regulation concerning a prohibition inter alia on use the measures must have a scope which goes well beyond a limitation to certain possible uses of the product in question and must thus not be confined to a mere restriction of its use.\n77. As the Advocate General pointed out in point 70 of his Opinion, that category of technical regulation is particularly intended to cover national measures which leave no room for any use which can reasonably be made of the product concerned other than a purely marginal one. It is for the national court to ascertain whether the prohibition entailed by the national provision at issue in the main proceedings is such a measure.”\nJudgment of 8 September 2005, Lidl Italia, C-303/04, EU:C:2005:528, paragraphs 12 and 13\nA national prohibition on the marketing of products which are not manufactured from certain materials constitutes a provision prohibiting the manufacture and marketing of products.\n“12. […] under Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34, a national provision of a Member State prohibiting the manufacture, importation, marketing or use of a product must be regarded as a category of technical regulation (see Case C-267/03 Lindberg [2005] ECR I-0000, paragraph 54).\n13. In the present case, it is sufficient to state that Article 19(2) of Law No 93/2001 is a provision of that kind. Under that provision, the manufacture and marketing of cotton buds which do not exhibit the features mentioned, namely those which are not manufactured entirely from biodegradable materials in accordance with UNI 10785 standards, constitute infringements attracting administrative penalties.”\nJudgment of 26 October 2006, Commission v Greece, C-65/05, EU:C:2006:673, paragraph 61\nMeasures prohibiting the installation, outside casinos, of all electrical or electronic game devices and the use of computer games in undertakings providing internet services as well as making the operation of such undertakings subject to the issue of a special licence must be regarded as technical regulations.\n“61. […] measures such as those provided for in Articles 2(1) and 3 of Law No 3037/2002, in so far as they prohibit the installation in Greece of all electrical, electromechanical and electronic games, including all computer games, on all public and private premises apart from casinos, and the use of games on computers in undertakings providing internet services, and make the operation of such undertakings subject to the issue of a special authorisation, must be considered to be technical regulations within the meaning of Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34 (see, to that effect, Case C-267/03 Lindberg [2005] ECR I-3247).”\nJudgment of 19 July 2012, Fortuna and Others, C-213/11, C-214/11 and C-217/11, EU:C:2012:495, paragraphs 24 and 25\nA measure prohibiting the use of gaming machines outside casinos must be classified as a ‘technical regulation’.\n“24. […] the Court has already held that measures which prohibit the use of all electrical, electromechanical and electronic games on all public and private premises apart from casinos must be considered to be technical regulations within the meaning of Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34 (Case C‑65/05 Commission v Greece [2006] ECR I‑10341, paragraph 61).\n25. Accordingly, a measure, such as Article 14(1) of the Law on games of chance, which permits only gaming casinos to organise gaming on machines must be classified as a ‘technical regulation’ within the meaning of Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34.”\nJudgment of 27 October 2016, James Elliott Construction, C-613/14, EU:C:2016:821, paragraph 70\nNational provisions laying down implied contractual conditions concerning the merchantable quality, fitness for use, or general quality of products sold do not constitute prohibition provisions.\n“70. […] the legislation at issue in the main proceedings does not fall within the scope of the technical regulations referred to in Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34, in so far as, by merely stating implied contractual requirements, it does not contain any prohibition, within the meaning of that directive, of the manufacture, importation, marketing or use of a product, the provision or use of a service, or establishment as a service provider.”\nJudgment of 28 May 2020, ECO-WIND Construction, C-727/17, EU:C:2020:393, paragraphs 45 to 47\nLegislation imposing a minimum distance for the installation of wind turbines does not constitute a prohibition on the manufacture, import, marketing or use of a product, unless it entails a de facto prohibition on the marketing of wind turbines, leaving no room for any use of wind turbines other than a purely marginal one.\n“45. That category presupposes that the measure at issue has a scope that goes clearly beyond a limitation to certain uses of the product at issue and that it is not confined to a mere restriction on its use (judgments of 21 April 2005, Lindberg, C‑267/03, EU:C:2005:246, paragraph 76, and of 19 July 2012, Fortuna and Others, C‑213/11, C‑214/11 and C‑217/11, EU:C:2012:495, paragraph 31).\n46. That category is particularly intended to cover national measures which leave no room for any use that could reasonably be made of the product concerned other than a purely marginal one (judgments of 21 April 2005, Lindberg, C‑267/03, EU:C:2005:246, paragraph 77, and of 19 July 2012, Fortuna and Others, C‑213/11, C‑214/11 and C‑217/11, EU:C:2012:495, paragraph 32).\n47. In the present case, although the requirement that the installation of a wind turbine is subject to compliance with the condition of a minimum distance between that wind turbine and buildings with a residential function, imposed by the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, admittedly includes a prohibition on installing a wind turbine at a minimum distance less than ten times the total height of the planned installation from any building having a residential function, it should be noted that that legislation does not, however, prohibit economic operators from continuing to install wind turbines and, therefore, using and marketing wind generators.”"}
{"doc_title": "Case-law on Directive (EU) 20151535", "chunk": "De Facto Technical Regulations\n“De facto technical regulations shall include:\nlaws, regulations or administrative provisions of a Member State which refer either to technical specifications or to other requirements or to rules on services, or to professional codes or codes of practice which in turn refer to technical specifications or to other requirements or to rules on services, compliance with which confers a  presumption of conformity with the obligations imposed by the aforementioned laws, regulations or administrative provisions;\nvoluntary agreements to which a public authority is a contracting party and which provide, in the general interest, for compliance with technical specifications or other requirements or rules on services, excluding public procurement tender specifications;\ntechnical specifications or other requirements or rules on services which are linked to fiscal or financial measures affecting the consumption of products or services by encouraging compliance with such technical specifications or other requirements or rules on services; technical specifications or other requirements or rules on services linked to national social security systems are not included.\nThis comprises technical regulations imposed by the authorities designated by the Member States and appearing on a list drawn up and updated, where appropriate, by the Commission, in the framework of the Committee referred to in Article 2.”\n(second and third sentence of Article 1(1)(f) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535)\nJudgment of 20 March 1997, Bic Benelux, C-13/96, EU:C:1997:173, paragraphs 23 to 25\nA marking requirement intended to inform the consumer of the environmental footprint of certain products and linked to a tax but constitutes a technical specification. It cannot be regarded as exclusively ‘linked to a fiscal measure’ and therefore does not fall within the definition of ‘de facto technical regulations’.\n“23. […] first, the marking requirement in issue in the main proceedings constitutes, according to the definition given in Article 1 (5) of Directive 83/189, a de jure technical regulation in that its 'observance ... is compulsory ... in the case of marketing' of the product concerned and in that it is, according to the definition given in Article 1(1), a technical specification, since the enactment defines 'the characteristics required of a product such as ... the requirements applicable to the product as regards ... marking or labelling'.\n24. Second, the marking in issue is intended to inform the public of, inter alia, the effects of the products on the environment, and the Belgian Government has confirmed the importance to be attached to that aspect of the rules governing marking. The aim of the environmental tax, which is to protect the environment, is thus reinforced by the marking, which, like other environmental labelling, whether linked to an environmental tax or not, reminds consumers of the harmful effects of the products in question on the environment.\n25. Since the marking requirement in issue can in no way be regarded as exclusively a fiscal accompanying measure, it does not therefore constitute a requirement linked to a fiscal measure for the purposes of the third indent of the second subparagraph of Article 1(9) of Directive 83/189, as amended by Directive 94/10.”\nJudgment of 10 July 2014, Ivansson and Others, C-307/13, EU:C:2014:2058, paragraphs 30 et 31\nA reference to detailed administrative rules containing ‘technical specifications’ or ‘other requirements’ may confer on a draft law the status of a ‘de facto technical regulation’.\n“30. […] it must be held that although that paragraph [of the national law] does not itself constitute a technical regulation, in its second subparagraph it refers to additional provisions concerning the rearing of hens which would be communicated at a later date by the Board of Agriculture.\n31. Such a reference to more detailed administrative rules is likely, provided that those rules can be regarded as themselves constituting ‘technical specifications’ or ‘other requirements’, to confer the status of ‘de facto technical regulation’ on Paragraph 9 of the DSF in accordance with the first indent of Article 1(11) of Directive 98/34.”\nJudgment of 11 June 2015, Berlington Hungary and Others, C-98/14, EU:C:2015:386, paragraphs 95 to 97\nNational provisions which multiply by five the tax payable on slot machines operated in amusement arcades and also introduce a proportional tax on that activity do not constitute ‘de facto technical regulations’, since they are fiscal provisions and not ‘technical specifications linked to a fiscal rule’ within the meaning of the Directive.\n“95. Under the third indent of Article 1(11) of that directive, the ‘de facto technical regulations’ within the meaning of that provision consist of ‘technical specifications or other requirements or rules on services which are linked to fiscal or financial measures affecting the consumption of products or services by encouraging compliance with such technical specifications or other requirements or rules on services’.\n96. It follows from that wording that the concept of ‘de facto technical regulations’ means, not the tax measures themselves, but the technical specifications or other requirements linked to it.\n97. Accordingly, tax legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which is not accompanied by any technical specification or any other requirement with which it is purportedly intended to ensure compliance, cannot be described as a ‘de facto technical regulation’.”\nJudgment of 8 October 2020, Admiral Sportwetten and Others, EU:C:2020:812, paragraphs 38 and 41\nTax legislation, which is not accompanied by any ‘technical specification’ or any other requirement with which it is intended to ensure compliance, cannot be classified as a ‘de facto technical regulation’. National tax legislation which provides for taxation of the operation of sports betting machines does not therefore constitute a ‘technical regulation’.\n“38. […] regarding de facto technical regulations within the meaning of Article 1(1)(f)(iii) of Directive 2015/1535, the Court has previously held that tax legislation, which is not accompanied by any technical specification or any other requirement with which it is purportedly intended to ensure compliance, cannot be described as a ‘de facto technical regulation’ (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 June 2015, Berlington Hungary and Others, C-98/14, EU:C:2015:386, paragraph 97).”\n“41. Consequently, having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 1 of Directive 2015/1535 must be interpreted as meaning that a national tax rule that provides for taxation of the operation of betting terminals does not constitute a ‘technical regulation’ within the meaning of that article.”\nJudgment of 22 December 2022, Airbnb Ireland and Airbnb Payments UK, C-83/21, EU:C:2022:1018, paragraphs 29 and 30\nLegislation of a fiscal nature cannot, as such, be classified as a ‘de facto technical regulation’.\n“29. As regards, in the third place, Directive 2015/1535, it should be noted that that directive refers to ‘the [FEU] Treaty, and in particular Articles 114, 337 and 43 thereof’. Thus, it should be noted at the outset that the exclusion laid down in Article 114(2) TFEU concerning ‘fiscal provisions’ also applies in relation to that directive, for the reasons set out in paragraph 25 of the present judgment.\n30. Furthermore, the content of Directive 2015/1535 indirectly confirms the exclusion of ‘fiscal provisions’ from its scope, since the wording of Article 1(1)(f)(iii) of that directive refers, among de facto technical regulations, to technical specifications or other requirements or rules on services which are ‘linked to fiscal or financial measures’. They are not therefore actual tax measures, but only measures linked to tax measures (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 October 2020, Admiral Sportwetten and Others, C‑711/19, EU:C:2020:812, paragraph 38); the latter therefore remain, as such, outside the scope of that directive.”"}

That concept is autonomously defined by Directive 2010/13/EU (formerly Directive 89/552/EEC), independently of the concept of ‘information society service’.\n“22. […] the scope of the concept of ‘television broadcasting’ can certainly not be inferred by exclusion from that of the concept of ‘information society service’. Directive 98/34, both in Article 1(2) and in Annex V, refers to services which are not covered by the concept of ‘information society service’ and which do not as such constitute television broadcasting services. This is the case, inter alia, of radio broadcasting services. Likewise, television broadcasting services cannot be limited to services ‘provided by transmitting data without individual demand for simultaneous reception by an unlimited number of individual receivers’, referred to in point 3 of Annex V to Directive 98/34. If that interpretation was followed, services such as television available by subscription, transmitted to a limited number of recipients, would be excluded from the concept of ‘television broadcasting service’, whereas they do come within that concept, by virtue of the criteria laid down in Article 1(a) of Directive 89/552.\n23. Lastly, it was not the intention of the Community legislature, when Directives 98/34 and 98/48 were adopted, to amend Directive 89/552, which itself had been amended less than a year earlier by Directive 97/36. Thus recital 20 to Directive 98/48, which amended Directive 98/34, states that Directive 98/48 ‘is without prejudice to the scope of … Directive 89/552’.”\nJudgment of 12 September 2019, VG Media, C-299/17, EU:C:2019:716, paragraph 38\n‘Technical rules’ in the field of intellectual property are not excluded from the scope of the Directive, unlike those relating to telecommunications or financial services.\n“ 38. […] the fact that Paragraph 87g(4) of the UrhG forms part of national legislation on copyright or rights related to copyright is not such as to call that assessment into question. Technical rules on intellectual property are not expressly excluded from the scope of Article 1(5) of Directive 98/34, unlike those forming the subject matter of European legislation in the field of telecommunications services or financial services. In addition, it is apparent from the judgment of 8 November 2007, Schwibbert (C-20/05, EU:C:2007:652) that provisions of national intellectual property legislation may constitute a ‘technical regulation’ subject to notification pursuant to Article 8(1) of that directive.”"}

Since the present action for failure to fulfil obligations is limited to an application for a declaration of failure to comply with the formal prior notification procedure, it is sufficient to point out, without its being necessary to reply to the other arguments of the parties, that the Court has already held that Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34 requires the Member States to communicate immediately to the Commission any draft technical regulation (see, in particular, to that effect, as regards provisions similar to those of that directive, judgments of 2 August 1993 in Case 139/92 Commission v Italy [4707] ECR-I 3, paragraph-31, and of 11 January 1996 in Case 273/94 Commission v Netherlands [15] ECR-I-, paragraph).\n40. Since the relevant provisions of Decree No 783/98 constitute technical regulations within the meaning of Directive 98/34, as stated in paragraph 31 of this judgment, the Portuguese Republic was required to notify them in draft form pursuant to Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34 (see, inter alia, to that effect, as regards provisions similar to those of Directive 98/34, judgments of 7 May 1998 in Case 145/97 Commission v Belgium [2643]-ECR-I-13, paragraph 43, and of 21 April 2005 in Case 267/03 Lindberg -ECR I-, paragraph).\n41.

By failing to give such notification before adoption of a technical regulation, Greece failed to fulfil its obligations under this Directive.\n“60. […] there is nothing in Regulation No 1367/2006 to support the view that the concept of ‘emissions into the environment’ within the meaning of the first sentence of Article 6(1) of that regulation must be limited to emissions emanating from certain industrial installations, such as factories and power stations.\n61. Nor may that restriction be inferred from the Aarhus Convention, which must be taken into account in interpreting Regulation No 1367/2006, since, as Article 1 thereof provides, the objective of that regulation is to contribute to the implementation of the obligations arising under that convention, by laying down rules to apply the provisions of that convention to EU institutions and bodies.\n62. On the contrary, as the Court noted in paragraph 72 of the judgment delivered today, Bayer CropScience and Stichting De Bijenstichting (C‑442/14), such a restriction would be contrary to the express wording of point (d) of the first subparagraph of Article 4(4) of the Aarhus Convention. That provision states that information on emissions which is relevant for the protection of the environment must be disclosed. Information concerning emissions emanating from sources other than industrial installations, such as those resulting from the use of plant protection products on plants or soil, are just as relevant to environmental protection as information relating to emissions of industrial origin.”"}

That argument cannot be upheld. The German regulation in question constitutes a new technical specification within the meaning of Article 1, cited above, since non reusable sterile medical instruments may henceforth be marketed or used in Germany only if certain obligations are fulfilled the application of which was formerly confined to the labelling of medicinal products. The application, to given products, of a rule which previously only affected other products, constitutes, with regard to the former, a new regulation and must therefore be notified in accordance with the directive.\n26. That finding is not called in question by the fact that, as contended by the German Government, the extension of the scope of the rule is based on an enabling provision which was previously communicated to the Commission. That enabling measure, taken as such, does not require to be notified on the basis of Article 8 aforesaid since it does not constitute a new specification. The situation is different as regards the implementation of that measure, which does constitute a new specification which must be notified.”\nJudgment of 3 June 1999, Colim NV, C-33/189, EU:C:1999:274, paragraph 22\nA national measure reproducing or replacing existing ‘technical regulations’, which have already been notified to the Commission, without adding new specifications, does not constitute a draft ‘technical regulation’.\n“22. […] the aim of Directive 83/189 is to protect, by preventive monitoring, the free movement of goods, which is one of the foundations of the Community (Case C-13/96 Bic Benelux ν Belgian State [1997] ECR I-1753, paragraph 19). That monitoring is designed to eliminate or reduce barriers to the free movement of goods that might result from technical regulations which the Member States propose to adopt. A national measure which reproduces or replaces, without adding new or additional specifications, existing technical regulations which, if adopted after the entry into force of Directive 83/189, have been duly notified to the Commission, cannot be regarded as a 'draft' technical regulation within the meaning of Article 1(6) of Directive 83/189 or, consequently, as subject to the obligation to notify.”\nJudgment of 21 April 2005, Lindberg, C-267/03, EU:C:2005:246, paragraphs 82 and 85\nA rule which merely reproduces or replaces rules already notified without adding new ‘technical regulations” does not need to be notified.\n“82. […] it must first be observed that a national measure which reproduces or replaces, without adding new or additional specifications, existing technical regulations which, if adopted after the entry into force of Directive 83/189, have been duly notified to the Commission, cannot be regarded as a ‘draft’ technical regulation within the meaning of Article 1(9) of Directive 83/189 or, consequently, as subject to the obligation to notify (see Colim, cited above, paragraph 22). In the present case, the date of the entry into force of Directive 83/189 as regards the Kingdom of Sweden should be taken into account.”\n“85. In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the third question must be that redefining in national legislation a service connected with the design of a product, in particular that of operating certain gaming machines, as the 1996 law did, can constitute a technical regulation which must be notified under Directive 83/189, if that new legislation does not merely reproduce or replace, without adding new or additional specifications, existing technical regulations which, if adopted after the entry into force of Directive 83/189 in the Member State concerned, have been duly notified to the Commission.”\nJudgment of 13 March 2025, Unigames UAB, C-120/24, EU:C:2025:174, paragraphs 57 and 58\nAn amendment to a draft technical regulation that substantially extends its scope must be notified. An amendment that introduces sanctions for new conduct must be regarded as substantially revising a technical regulation.\n“57. It is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling that Article 10(19) of the Law on gambling ‘substantially revised’ the prohibition on encouraging participation in gambling. In particular, the referring court states that the conduct of which Unigames is accused on the basis of the law currently in force, consisting of the publication, on that company’s website, of information relating to the gambling activities offered by it, was not liable to be punished under the former Law on gambling. Therefore, according to the referring court, that Article 10(19) extended the scope of that prohibition.\n58. It thus follows from the information set out in the request for a preliminary ruling that Article 10(19) of the Law on gambling added new or additional requirements, within the meaning of the case-law referred to in paragraph 52 of the present judgment, in comparison with Article 10(19) of the former Law on gambling. It follows that, subject to any verifications which it is for the referring court to carry out, the amendment that gave rise to the law currently in force should have been notified under the first subparagraph of Article 5(1) of Directive 2015/1535.”"}

[…] in the light of the objective of Directive 98/34, referred to in paragraph 41 above, amendments made to a draft technical regulation already notified to the Commission pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34, which contain, in relation to the notified draft, merely a relaxation of the conditions of use of the product in question and which, therefore, reduce the possible impact of the technical regulation on trade, are not a significant alteration of the draft for the purposes of the third subparagraph of Article 8(1) of that directive. Such amendments are not, therefore, subject to the obligation of prior notification.\n48. Although, under Article 8(3) of Directive 98/34, Member States are to communicate the definitive text of a technical regulation to the Commission without delay, the failure to communicate a non-significant amendment to such a regulation prior to its adoption does not affect the applicability of that regulation, if there is no obligation of prior notification.”\nJudgment of 31 January 2013, Belgische Petroleum Unie and Others, C-26/11, EU:C:2013:44, paragraphs 56 and 57\nThe directive does not require re-notification of draft national legislation where, after having been notified, the draft has been amended to take account of the Commission’s comments and the amended draft has subsequently been communicated to the Commission.\n“56. […] the Kingdom of Belgium, in these circumstances, restricted itself to amending the provisions of draft legislation in accordance with a request from the Commission to remove a barrier to trade, and so, by virtue of Article 10(1), final indent, of Directive 98/34, the obligation to notify the Commission under the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) of that directive does not apply to the draft Law on the blending obligation.\n57. In those circumstances, the answer to the second question is that Article 8 of Directive 98/34, read in conjunction with Article 10(1), final indent, of that directive, must be interpreted as not requiring notification of draft national legislation which obliges petroleum companies placing petrol and/or diesel fuels on the market also to place on the market, in the same calendar year, certain percentages of biofuels, where, after having been notified pursuant to the first subparagraph of Article 8(1), the draft was amended to take account of the Commission’s observations on it, and the amended draft was then communicated to the Commission.”\nJudgment of 10 July 2014, Ivansson and Others, C-307/13, EU:C:2014:2058, paragraphs 48 to 50\nAny significant change to the timetable for the implementation of a national measure, including a substantial shortening, must be communicated to the Commission. Failure to notify renders the measure inapplicable and unenforceable against individuals.\n“48. In that regard, it must be borne in mind that the Court has held that a failure to observe the obligation to notify the Commission constitutes a procedural defect in the adoption of the technical regulations concerned, and renders those technical regulations inapplicable and therefore unenforceable against individuals (see, in particular, judgment in CIA Security International, C‑194/94, EU:C:1996:172, paragraph 54, and judgment in Schwibbert, C‑20/05, EU:C:2007:652, paragraph 44). Individuals may rely on that inapplicability before the national court which must decline to apply a national technical regulation which has not been notified in accordance with Directive 98/34 (see, in particular, judgment in Schwibbert, EU:C:2007:652, paragraph 44 and the case-law cited).\n49. It follows therefrom that, if the communication to the Commission of Paragraph 9 of the DSF actually contained the date of 1 May 2003 as the date of the entry into force and the shortening of its timetable for implementation to 15 April 2003 was significant in nature, the failure to make a new communication of that national provision to the Commission would render it unenforceable against the defendants in the main proceedings.\n50. The answer to the second question is, consequently, that, if the shortening of the timetable for the entry into force of a technical regulation is subject to the obligation of communication to the Commission, as laid down in the third subparagraph of Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34, the failure to make such a communication would render that national measure inapplicable, such that it could not be enforced against individuals.”"}

Directive 91/492 for its part contains much wider provisions on the marketing not only of bivalve molluscs but also of marine gastropods, tunicates and echinoderms. It lays down new requirements for all stages of gathering, handling, storing, transporting and distributing molluscs, and also introduces a system of registration and marking to allow the origin of each batch to be identified for health purposes.\n44. Moreover, the absence of a direct link between Directive 91/492 and the two decrees in question is confirmed by the Italian Government's assertion that that directive was transposed into Italian law by means of Legislative Decree No 530 of 30 December 1992, referred to above, which, as it says itself, constitutes the only measure for the implementation of Directive 91/492 and in respect of which the Commission sent a detailed opinion on 27 January 1993 criticizing that decree in that it applied to another toxin (NSP) not referred to in Directive 91/492.\n45. Since they do not constitute measures transposing Directive 91/492 such as to justify application of Article 10 of Directive 83/189, Decree No 257 of 1 August 1990 and the Decree of 1 September 1990 had to be notified to the Commission pursuant to Article 8 of the latter directive.”\nJudgment of 26 September 2000, Unilever, C-443/98, EU:C:2000:496, paragraphs 28 and 29\nWhere Member States have a wide margin of discretion in transposing an EU directive, national measures adopted to that effect cannot be regarded as national provisions ‘comply[ing] with a binding Community act’.\n“28. Second, the Italian Government submits that the contested Law was exempted from the requirement of notification under Article 10 of Directive 83/189 since it was adopted in accordance with Council Directive 79/112/EEC of 18 December 1978 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the labelling, presentation and advertising of foodstuffs for sale to the ultimate consumer (OJ 1979 L 33, p. 1). Article 3(1)(7) of that directive requires that the place of origin or provenance of the product be indicated on the label in cases where omission of such information would be liable to mislead consumers as to the real origin or provenance of the foodstuff.\n29. That contention cannot be accepted. As the Commission has pointed out, that provision of Directive 79/112, drafted in general terms, leaves the Member States sufficient room for manoeuvre for it to be concluded that national rules on labelling relating to origin such as those adopted in the contested Law cannot be regarded as national provisions conforming to a binding Community act within the meaning of the first indent of Article 10(1) of Directive 83/189.”\nJudgment of 22 January 2000, Canal Satélite Digital, C-390/99, EU:C:2002:34, paragraph 48\nNational provisions transposing binding Community measures containing “technical specifications” are not subject to the notification obligation, provided that they are strictly limited to such transposition.\n“48. As regards the second part of the third question, which relates to the obligation under Article 8 of Directive 83/189 to communicate any draft technical regulation to the Commission, Article 10 of that directive shows that Articles 8 and 9 do not apply to laws, regulations or administrative provisions of Member States, or to voluntary agreements entered into by them, whereby Member States comply with binding Community measures which result in the adoption of technical specifications. So, to the extent that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings transposes Directive 95/47, and to that extent only, there will be no duty of notification under Directive 83/189.”\nJudgment of 8 September 2005, Commission v Portugal, C-500/03, EU:C:2005:515, paragraphs 34 and 35\nNational provisions determining the characteristics of recreational craft cannot benefit from the exemption from notification reserved for transpositions, where the directive relied upon leaves Member States free to define the conditions they consider necessary to protect the environment, the configuration, and the safety of waterways.\n(The judgement being solely available in French and Portuguese, the following text is a translation.)\n“34. […]Member States have the right, provided for in Article 2(2) of Directive 94/25, to define, at national level, the conditions which they consider necessary with regard to navigation in certain waters in order to protect the environment and the fabric of waterways and to ensure safety on those waters. However, those provisions of national legislation cannot under any circumstances be regarded as having been adopted for the purposes of compliance with a binding Community act.\n35. It follows that the Regulation on navigation in lagoons, which introduces technical limits for recreational craft pursuant to Article 2(2) of Directive 94/25, does not fall within the scope of the first indent of Article 10(1) of Directive 98/34.”"}

Since the present action for failure to fulfil obligations is limited to an application for a declaration of failure to comply with the formal prior notification procedure, it is sufficient to point out, without its being necessary to reply to the other arguments of the parties, that the Court has already held that Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34 requires the Member States to communicate immediately to the Commission any draft technical regulation (see, in particular, to that effect, as regards provisions similar to those of that directive, judgments of 2 August 1993 in Case C-139/92 Commission v Italy [4707] ECR I-3, paragraph 31, and of 11 January 1996 in Case C-273/94 Commission v Netherlands [15] ECR I-, paragraph).\n40. Since the relevant provisions of Decree No 783/98 constitute technical regulations within the meaning of Directive 98/34, as stated in paragraph 31 of this judgment, the Portuguese Republic was required to notify them in draft form pursuant to Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34 (see, inter alia, to that effect, as regards provisions similar to those of Directive 98/34, judgments of 7 May 1998 in Case C-145/97CommissionvBelgium [2643] ECR I-13, paragraph 43, and of 21 April 2005 in Case C-267/03Lindberg ECR I-, paragraph).”\nJudgment of 8 October 2020, Union des industries de la protection des plantes, C-514/19, EU:C:2020:803, paragraphs 46 and 47\n(referring to the Opinion of the Advocate General Kokott, EU:C:2020:422, paragraph 58)\nA clause corresponding to the definition in Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is a safeguard clause, even if it is not so named by the act providing for it. It therefore benefits from an exemption from the notification obligation.\n(Judgement of the Court) “46      […] Article 71(1) of that regulation must be treated as a safeguard clause, as the Advocate General stated in point 58 of her Opinion.\n47. The difference between the procedures laid down in Article 5 of that directive and Article 71 of that regulation respectively is therefore confirmed by Article 7(1)(c) of that directive, which provides that Articles 5 and 6 of that directive are not to apply to the provisions of the Member States by which the latter make use of safeguard clauses provided for in binding Union acts.”\n(opinion of Advocate General Kokott) “58.      Although, unlike a number of comparable provisions, Article 71 of the Plant Protection Regulation is not entitled ‘safeguard clause’, its content corresponds to the definition of safeguard clauses in Article 114(10) TFEU. It can therefore also be regarded as a safeguard clause for the purposes of Article 7(1)(c) of the Notification Directive.”\nJudgment of 9 March 2023, Vapo Atlantic, C-604/21, EU:C:2023:175, paragraphs 55 to 57\nAn exception to the notification requirement based on a 'safeguard clause' is only possible if the harmonisation act invoked explicitly contains a clause corresponding to the definition set out in Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.\n“55. It should be noted that the first two subparagraphs of Article 4(1) of Directive 2009/30 merely lay down a period within which the Member States are to transpose the directive, that is to say, by 31 December 2010 at the latest, by means of laws, regulations or administrative provisions necessary for that purpose, while requesting them to communicate immediately to the Commission the text of those provisions. The third subparagraph of that provision provides that, when Member States adopt those provisions, they are to refer to Directive 2009/30.\n56. There is nothing, however, in the wording of Article 4(1) of Directive 2009/30 to suggest that the EU legislature intended to introduce in that directive a safeguard clause, within the meaning of Article 114(10) TFEU, which the Member States could have used.\n57. In that regard, the latter provision provides that harmonisation measures are, in appropriate cases, to include a safeguard clause authorising the Member States to take, for one or more of the non-economic reasons referred to in Article 36 TFEU, provisional measures subject to an EU control procedure. It follows that such a safeguard clause must be expressly provided for in the harmonising measure. Article 4(1) of Directive 2009/30 does not have those characteristics and cannot, therefore, constitute such a safeguard clause.”"}

That assessment cannot be undermined by the Netherlands Government's argument that the effect of the disputed order is to encourage the marketing of margarine and that it therefore complies with the directive's main objective of eliminating barriers to intra-Community trade in goods.\n15. Member States are required to communicate to the Commission any draft technical regulation in accordance with Article 8 of the directive. Such an obligation cannot be subject to the unilateral assessment by the Member State which drafted the regulation of the effects which it may have on trade between Member States.”\nJudgment of 16 June 1998, Lemmens, C-226/97, EU:C:1998:296, paragraphs 18 to 20\nThe Directive applies to “technical regulations” irrespective of the reason for their adoption. The fact that a measure covers criminal law does not exempt it from the notification obligation. Thus, the national provisions governing the respiratory analysis apparatus used by the police to measure alcohol constitute a technical regulation that should have been notified to the Commission prior to its adoption.\n“18. The French Government, for its part, contends that the Directive does not apply to products which, like those in this case, are intended to be used in connection with the exercise of public authority and a fortiori in criminal proceedings instituted by the Member States.\n19. Those arguments cannot be accepted. Although in principle criminal legislation and the rules of criminal procedure are matters for which the Member States are responsible, it does not follow that this branch of the law cannot be affected by Community law (see, to that effect, Case 186/87 Cowan [1989] ECR 195, paragraph19, and Case 203/80 Casati [1981] ECR 2595, paragraph 27).\n20. In this case, there is nothing in the Directive to suggest that technical regulations within the meaning of Article 1 thereof are excluded from the notification requirement because they fall within the scope of criminal law, or that the scope of the Directive is limited to products intended to be used otherwise than in connection with the exercise of public authority. As the Court has already stated in Case C-13/96 Bic Benelux [1997] ECR I-1753, paragraph 19, a directive applies to technical regulations irrespective of the grounds on which they were adopted.”\nJudgment of 21 April 2005, Lindberg, C-267/03, EU:C:2005:246, paragraphs 86, 91 and 92\nThe value of the product to which a rule relates, the size of its market and the effect of that rule on intra-Community trade are not relevant criteria for determining whether a ‘technical regulation’ must be notified.\n“86. By its fourth question, the referring court seeks the views of the Court on the significance for the purpose of the obligation to notify laid down by Directive 83/189 of the following factors:\n–      the replacement of a licence requirement by a prohibition in national law,\n–      the greater or lesser value of the product/service,\n–      the size of the market for the product/service or\n–      the effect of a new national provision on use, which could be either a total prohibition on use or a prohibition or restriction within one of a number of possible areas of use?”\n“91. As regards the second and third factors mentioned in the fourth question referred for a preliminary ruling, it must be observed that, as pointed out in paragraph 50 of this judgment, Directive 83/189 lays down a preventive monitoring procedure for ascertaining whether a national standard comprising a technical regulation falls within the Treaty provisions on free movement of goods and, if so, for examining whether such a standard is compatible with those provisions.\n92. On that point, it was held in paragraph 51 of this judgment that the possible effects of the technical regulation on intra-Community trade do not constitute a criterion for the definition of the scope of Directive 83/189, as regards, in particular, the obligation to notify for which it provides.\""}

{"doc_title": "Case-law on Directive (EU) 20151535", "chunk": "Inapplicability in the Event of Non-Notification\nJudgment of 30 April 1996, CIA Security International SA, C-194/94, EU:C:1996:172, paragraphs 48 and 55\nBreach of the notification obligation renders the ‘technical regulations’ concerned inapplicable, so that they cannot be enforced against individuals. Individuals may rely on Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 83/189 before a national court which must refuse to apply a national ‘technical regulation’ which has not been notified in accordance with that directive.\n“48. For such a consequence to arise from a breach of the obligations laid down by Directive 83/189, an express provision to this effect is not required. As pointed out above, it is undisputed that the aim of the directive is to protect freedom of movement for goods by means of preventive control and that the obligation to notify is essential for achieving such Community control. The effectiveness of Community control will be that much greater if the directive is interpreted as meaning that breach of the obligation to notify constitutes a substantial procedural defect such as to render the technical regulations in question inapplicable to individuals.”\n“55. The answer to the fifth and sixth questions must therefore be that Articles 8 and 9 of Directive 83/189 are to be interpreted as meaning that individuals may rely on them before the national court which must decline to apply a national technical regulation which has not been notified in accordance with the directive.”\nJudgment of 16 June 1998, Lemmens, C-226/97, EU:C:1998:296, paragraphs 34 to 37\nFailure to comply with the obligation to notify a technical regulation relating to breath-analysis apparatus does not have the effect of rendering unenforceable against an individual charged with drink-driving the evidence obtained by means of breath-analysis apparatus authorised in accordance with rules which have not been notified.\n“34. In criminal proceedings such as those in the main action, the regulations applied to the accused are those which, on the one hand, prohibit and penalise driving while under the influence of alcohol and, on the other, require a driver to exhale his breath into an apparatus designed to measure the alcohol content, the result of that test constituting evidence in criminal proceedings. Such regulations differ from those which, not having been notified to the Commission in accordance with the Directive, are unenforceable against individuals.\n35. While failure to notify technical regulations, which constitutes a procedural defect in their adoption, renders such regulations inapplicable inasmuch as they hinder the use or marketing of a product which is not in conformity therewith, it does not have the effect of rendering unlawful any use of a product which is in conformity with regulations which have not been notified.\n36. The use of the product by the public authorities, in a case such as this, is not liable to create an obstacle to trade which could have been avoided if the notification procedure had been followed.\n37. The answer to the first question must therefore be that the Directive is to be interpreted as meaning that breach of the obligation imposed by Article 8 thereof to notify a technical regulation on breath-analysis apparatus does not have the effect of making it impossible for evidence obtained by means of such apparatus, authorised in accordance with regulations which have not been notified, to be relied upon against an individual charged with driving while under the influence of alcohol.”\nJudgment of 6 June 2002, Sapod Audic, C-159/00, EU:C:2002:343, paragraphs 52 and 53\nIt is for the national court to refuse to apply provisions that are inapplicable due to a failure to notify. The consequences of such inapplicability are governed by national law, provided that it is not less favourable than for similar domestic actions and does not render impossible the exercise of EU rights.\n“52. It should, however, be observed that the question of the conclusions to be drawn in the main proceedings from the inapplicability of the second paragraph of Article 4 of Decree No 92-377 as regards the severity of the sanction under the applicable national law, such as nullity or unenforceability of the contract between Sapod and Eco-Emballages, is a question governed by national law, in particular as regards the rules and principles of contract law which limit or adjust that sanction in order to render its severity proportionate to the particular defect found. However, those rules and principles may not be less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence) and may not be framed in such a way as to render impossible in practice the exercise of rights conferred by Community law (principle of effectiveness) (see, inter alia, Case 33/76 Rewe v Landwirtschaftskammer für das Saarland [1976] ECR 1989, paragraph 5, and Joined Cases C-52/99 and C-53/99 Camorotto and Vignone [2001] ECR I-1395, paragraph 21).\n53. The answer to the second part of the second question, in so far as it concerns Directive 83/189, must therefore be that, in the event that a national provision such as the second paragraph of Article 4 of Decree No 92-377 were to be interpreted as requiring a mark or label to be applied, an individual may invoke the failure to make notification of that national provision in accordance with Article 8 of that directive. It is then for the national court to refuse to apply that provision, the question of the conclusions to bedrawn from the inapplicability of that national provision as regards the severity of the sanction under the applicable national law, such as nullity or unenforceability of a contract, being a question governed by national law. That conclusion is, however, subject to the condition that the applicable rules of national law are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions and are not framed in such a way as to render impossible in practice the exercise of rights conferred by Community law.”\nJudgment of 8 September 2005, Lidl Italia, C-303/04, EU:C:2005:528, paragraphs 22 and 23\nBreach of the obligation to notify constitutes a substantial procedural defect such as to render the ‘technical regulations’ in question inapplicable and therefore unenforceable against individuals.\n“22. […] it is settled case-law that Directive 98/34 is designed to protect, by means of preventive monitoring, the free movement of goods, which is one of the foundations of the Community and that this control serves a useful purpose in that technical regulations falling within the scope of that directive may constitute obstacles to trade in goods between Member States, such obstacles being permissible only if they are necessary to satisfy compelling requirements relating to the public interest (see, to that effect, Case C-194/94 CIA Security International [1996] ECR I-2201, paragraph 40, and Case C-226/97 Lemmens [1998] ECR I-3711, paragraph 32).\n23. As the obligation to notify referred to, inter alia, in the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34 is essential for achieving that Community control, the effectiveness of such control will be that much greater if that directive is interpreted as meaning that failure to observe the obligation to notify constitutes a substantial procedural defect such as to render the technical regulations in question inapplicable and therefore unenforceable against individuals (CIA Security International, paragraphs 44, 48 and 54, and Lemmens, paragraph 33).”\nJudgment of 31 January 2013, Belgische Petroleum Unie and Others, C-26/11, EU:C:2013:44, paragraph 50\nBreach of the obligation to notify constitutes a substantial procedural defect such as to render the ‘technical regulations’ in question inapplicable and therefore unenforceable against individuals.\n“50.  As the obligation to notify referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34 is essential for achieving that control, the effectiveness of such control will be that much greater if that directive is interpreted as meaning that failure to observe the obligation to notify constitutes a substantive procedural defect such as to render the technical regulations in question inapplicable and therefore unenforceable against individuals (see Lidl Italia, paragraph 23 and Sandström, paragraph 43).”\nJudgment of 2 February 2016, Ince, C-336/14, EU:C:2016:72, paragraphs 67 and 68\nFailure to notify a ‘technical regulation’ renders it inapplicable and unenforceable against individuals. The latter may invoke Article 8 of Directive 98/34 before national courts, which are therefore obliged to refuse to apply the non-notified rule.\n“67. As a preliminary point, it must be borne in mind that a breach of the notification obligation laid down in Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34 constitutes a procedural defect in the adoption of the technical regulations concerned, and renders those technical regulations inapplicable and therefore unenforceable against individuals (see, inter alia, judgment in Ivansson and Others, C‑307/13, EU:C:2014:2058, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).\n68. In that regard, it should be emphasised that, as the Advocate General noted in point 60 of his Opinion, even though Article 8(1) of that directive requires the entire draft of a law containing technical regulations to be communicated to the Commission (see, to that effect, judgment in Commission v Italy, C‑279/94, EU:C:1997:396, paragraphs 40 and 41), the non-applicability which results from the breach of that obligation extends not to all of the provisions of such a law, but only to the technical regulations contained therein.”\nOrder of 21 April 2016, Beca Engineering, C-285/15, EU:C:2016:295, paragraph 37\nFailure to notify a ‘technical regulation’ renders it inapplicable and unenforceable against individuals, who may invoke Article 8 of Directive 98/34 before national courts, which are consequently obliged to refuse its application.\n(As the order is solely available in French and Italian, the following text is a translation.)\n“37. It is settled case-law that failure to comply with the obligation of immediate notification of technical regulations by the Member States to the Commission, laid down in Article 8 of Directive 98/34, renders the technical regulations concerned inapplicable, so that they cannot be enforced against individuals and the latter may thus rely on Article 8 of Directive 98/34 before the national court, which must refuse to apply a national technical regulation which has not been notified in accordance with that directive (see, to that effect, judgments of 30 April 1996 inCIA Security International-, 194/94, EU:C:1996:172, paragraphs 44 and 54; of 26 September 2000, Unilever,-443/98, EU:C:2000:496, paragraph 49; and of 16 July 2015, UNIC and Uni.co.pel, 95/14-, EU:C:2015:492, paragraph 29).”\nJudgment of 1 February 2017, Município de Palmela, C-144/16, EU:C:2017:76, paragraphs 36 and 37\nThe inapplicability of non-notified technical regulations extends only to the provisions qualifying as such and not to the entire text in which they are laid down.\n“36. Moreover, the penalty for failure to comply with such a notification obligation is that technical rules which have not been notified will be inapplicable (see, to that effect, with regard to Directive 83/189, judgment of 30 April 1996, CIA Security International, C‑194/94, EU:C:1996:172, paragraph 54, and, with regard to Directive 98/34, judgment of 4 February 2016, Ince, C‑336/14, EU:C:2016:72, paragraph 67 and the case-law cited).\n37. As regards the extent of such a penalty, even though Article 8(1) of Directive 83/189 and Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34 require the entire draft of a law containing technical regulations to be communicated to the Commission, the non-applicability which results from the breach of that obligation extends, not to all of the provisions of such a law, but only to the technical regulations contained therein (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 February 2016, Ince, C‑336/14, EU:C:2016:72, paragraph 68).”\nJudgment of 12 September 2019, VG Media, C-299/17, EU:C:2019:716, paragraph 39\nThe inapplicability of a non-notified ‘technical regulation’ may be relied on in proceedings between individuals.\n“39. In so far as a rule, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, is specifically aimed at information society services, the draft technical regulation must be subject to prior notification to the Commission pursuant to Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34. Failing that, according to settled case-law, the inapplicability of a technical regulation that has not been notified in accordance with that provision may be relied upon in proceedings between individuals (judgment of 27 October 2016, James Elliott Construction, C-613/14, EU:C:2016:821, paragraph 64 and the case-law cited).”"}
{"doc_title": "Case-law on Directive (EU) 20151535", "chunk": "Inapplicability in the Event of Adoption During the Standstill Period\nJudgment of 26 September 2000, Unilever, C-443/98, EU:C:2000:496, paragraphs 44 and 49\nThe breach of the obligation to postpone the adoption of a ‘technical regulation’ constitutes a substantial procedural defect, and the resulting inapplicability may be raised in civil contract law litigation proceedings.\n“44. Although, in paragraph 48 of CIA Security, after reiterating that the aim of Directive 83/189 was to protect freedom of movement for goods by means of preventive control and that the obligation to notify was essential for achieving such Community control, the Court found that the effectiveness of such control would be that much greater if the directive were interpreted as meaning that breach of the obligation to notify constituted a substantial procedural defect such as to render the technical regulations in question inapplicable to individuals, it follows from the considerations set out in paragraphs 40 to 43 of this judgment that breach of the obligations of postponement of adoption set out in Article 9 of Directive 83/189 also constitutes a substantial procedural defect such as to render technical regulations inapplicable.”\n“49. Thus, it follows from the case-law of the Court that the inapplicability of a technical regulation which has not been notified in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 83/189 can be invoked in proceedings between individuals for the reasons set out in paragraphs 40 to 43 of this judgment. The same applies to failure to comply with the obligations laid down by Article 9 of that directive and there is no need, in that regard, to treat disputes between individuals in matters of unfair competition differently, as in CIA Security International, from disputes between individuals concerning rights and obligations of a contractual nature, as in the main proceedings.”\nJudgment of 16 July 2015, UNIC and Uni.co.pel, C-95/14, EU:C:2015:492, paragraphs 29 and 30\nA ‘technical regulation’ cannot be applied if it has not been notified or if, although notified, it has been adopted and implemented before the end of the standstill period. Failure to comply with that standstill period constitutes a substantive procedural defect rendering the ‘technical regulation’ in question inapplicable and unenforceable against individuals.\n“29. In that respect, it must be noted that a technical regulation cannot be applied if it has not been notified in accordance with Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34, or if, though notified, it has been adopted and implemented before the end of the three month standstill period required under Article 9(1) of that directive (see judgments in CIA Security International, C‑194/94, EU:C:1996:172, paragraphs 41, 44 and 54, and Unilever, C‑443/98, EU:C:2000:496, paragraph 49).\n30. Consequently, in the main proceedings, it is for the referring court to verify whether Law No 8/2013 entered into force without respecting the standstill period required under Article 9 of Directive 98/34. If so, the failure to respect that standstill period is a material procedural defect rendering the technical regulation at issue inapplicable. As the Advocate General pointed out in points 44 to 47 of her Opinion, Article 3(2) of Law No 8/2103 would, in that case, be unenforceable against individuals.”\nJudgment of 21 December 2023, Papier Mettler Italia, C-86/22, EU:C:2023:1023, paragraphs 48 and 51\nThe adoption of a draft “technical regulation” six days after its notification is contrary to the Directive.\nClauses making the entry into force of legislation subject to the absence of a reaction from the Commission on that legislation (“suspensive clauses”) are contrary to the Directive because the adoption of such legislation does not allow the views of other Member States to be taken into account and it infringes the principle of legal certainty.\n“48. Second, the adoption of the decree at issue in the main proceedings within six days of its notification to the Commission under Article 8(1) of that directive also infringes the obligation laid down in Article 9(1) thereof, under which Member States are to postpone the adoption of a ‘draft technical regulation’ for three months from the date of receipt by the Commission of the communication referred to in Article 8(1) of the directive.”\n“51. Moreover, that government maintains that the entry into force of the decree at issue in the main proceedings was made conditional, under Article 6 therefore, on the ‘successful outcome’ of the notification procedure initiated on 12 March 2013 on the basis of Article 8(1) of Directive 98/34. However, that procedure did not have such an outcome because the Commission did not issue an opinion regarding that decree. That argument must rejected given that, first, the adoption and publication of that decree are capable per se of having certain effects on the free movement of the goods concerned; second, they did not make it possible to take account of the observations and detailed opinions issued by the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; third, as observed by the Advocate General in point 52 of his Opinion, they constitute a legislative technique which is incompatible with the principle of legal certainty.”"}
{"doc_title": "Case-law on Directive (EU) 20151535", "chunk": "Clarification as to the Effect of Inapplicability\nJudgment of 11 June 2015, Berlington Hungary and Others, C-98/14, EU:C:2015:386, paragraphs 108 and 109\nNotification and standstill obligations are not intended to confer rights on individuals. Consequently, their breach by a Member State does not, under EU law, give individuals a right to seek compensation from that Member State for any resulting damage.\n“108. In that regard, it is apparent from the case-law that, although Directive 98/34 is intended to ensure the free movement of goods by organising a preventive control the effectiveness of which requires the disapplication, in the context of a dispute between individuals, of a national measure adopted in breach of Articles 8 and 9 thereof, that directive does not in any way define the substantive scope of the legal rule on the basis of which the national court must decide the case before it. Thus, that directive creates neither rights nor obligations for individuals (judgment in Unilever, C‑443/98, EU:C:2000:496, paragraph 51).\n109. In those circumstances, it must be held that the first of the conditions listed in paragraph 104 is not fulfilled, so that individuals cannot rely on the infringement of Articles 8 and 9 of that directive to establish liability on the part of the Member State concerned on the basis of EU law.”"}
{"doc_title": "Case-law on Directive (EU) 20151535", "chunk": "Infringement Procedure\nJudgment of 4 June 2009, Commission v Greece, C-109/08, EU:C:2009:346, paragraphs 14 to 17\nA judgment of the Court finding a failure to fulfil the obligation to notify must be complied with immediately to ensure the uniform application of EU law. The question of whether there has been such a failure under Article 228 EC is assessed at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion. In the present case, since Greece took no measures before the expiry of the prescribed period, it has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 228(1) EC.\n“14. Although Article 228 EC does not specify the period within which a judgment of the Court establishing that a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations must be complied with, it follows from settled case-law that the importance of immediate and uniform application of Community law means that the process of compliance must be initiated at once and completed as soon as possible (see, inter alia, Case C-121/07 Commission v France [2008] ECR I-0000, paragraph 21 and the case-law cited).\n15. In addition, the reference date for assessing whether there has been a failure to fulfil obligations under Article 228 EC is the date of expiry of the period prescribed in the reasoned opinion issued under that provision (see, inter alia, Case C-503/04 Commission v Germany [2007] ECR I-6153, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited).\n16. In the present case, it is quite clear that, by the date on which the two-month period laid down in the reasoned opinion of 29 June 2007 expired, the Hellenic Republic had not taken any of the measures necessary for compliance with the judgment in Case C-65/05 Commission v Greece, since the draft of a first measure designed to comply with that judgment was not notified to the Commission until 7 May 2008.\n17. In those circumstances, it must be held that, as it itself acknowledges, the Hellenic Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 228(1) EC.”"}
